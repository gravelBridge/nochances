**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

I feel that this was the worst part of my application, I‚Äôve always had a really hard time making connections with teachers and it‚Äôs something I want to work on. This also wasn‚Äôt helped by the fact that the teachers I wanted to ask left the school and I only got to know these teachers minimally through virtual Zoom school.

11th Grade Language Arts Teacher (5/10) - I think she liked me well enough but I wasn‚Äôt really a outstanding student and we didn‚Äôt ever have very engaging conversations.

BC Calc Teacher (3/10) - I didn‚Äôt participate in class much and he always complained about writing rec letters. We also never really had any conversations either. (I didn‚Äôt have any other STEM teacher I could have asked because they all left the school and I couldn‚Äôt reach them)

**Interviews**

MIT (5/10) - Had a tech issue that made me join late. Conversation felt really forced and didn‚Äôt go smoothly because I didn‚Äôt have enough questions to ask her and she barely had any for me. 

Northwestern (6/10) - Interviewer barely asked me any questions and just talked about the school the whole time.

Princeton (1/10) - She ended it after 15 minutes which actually shocked me because I thought it was going well.

**Essays**

I feel that my common app essay was the best part of my application. It was the story of how I joined the political activism organization out of a drive to do more, and ended up inspiring my friends and community to do the same to become more involved in the state of our futures. I think it really showed my personality and it described how I want to weave together electrical engineering and policy to work in the renewable energy sector to help solve climate change.

I‚Äôve also always known since I was in 6th grade that I would be going to Georgia Tech, so I guess I got exactly what I expected.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Hospice Director - 10/10. A very unique LoR, and he‚Äôs a great man that helped me develop mentally through my job at the hospice. 

Math teacher - 8/10. Knows me well, but a lot of people have their LoRs from teachers so it‚Äôs nothing special. 

Judo coach - 10/10. My second father basically, had to translate the letter to english tho(because of the obvious reasons, it‚Äôs rare that someone knows english here lmao). 

**Interviews**
Don‚Äôt like talking to people under such circumstances because I have problems with my nerves üíÄ. 

Important note: All my interviewers were russian-speaking people(it‚Äôs the policy i guess), but the interviews were in english.

Yale - 10/10. A pure genius with kinda similar passions so we had a huge connection. 

UPenn - 0/10. I‚Äôve never met such an arrogant person‚Ä¶ The interview lasted barely 20 mins, where 10 was just his monologue about his achievements in university LMFAO. Reported this mf cause the attitude is unacceptable, you aren‚Äôt supposed to fcking humiliate your interviewee! 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Spent a month writing my personal statement. It was worth it for sure. Spoke about the intolerance of russian people that has seriously affected my world perception and connected it with my passions. 

Sups were boring af, so i was just doing the copy-paste type shit (common practice i hope)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. **Shadowed Undergraduate Research**. I didn't have time to participate in actual research, but I got to be an assistant to undergrad students completing biomedical summer research. I was only in the lab for two weeks, but it was really cool exposure and the PI answered all of my questions. I also got a letter of rec out of this! This role is definitely not that impressive though because I didn't conduct any research or write any papers.
2. **Worked as a caring partner in a nursing home**. I worked at a nursing home over the summer for 8 weeks. I helped at the nursing stations and activities department, assisting both nurses and residents. I also gained a lot of clinical experience by helping the residents with small tasks. This was a really cool experience and exposed me to the healthcare field and the workings of nursing homes. This role took up most of my senior year summer.
3. **Volunteer teaching position**. In this role, I worked with eight fellow seniors in orienting the freshman class to our school's volunteering program. Twice a month, we teach the freshman about social justice topics around the world. This role is also one of the highest honors one can have in my school, and is definitely a huge time commitment. Made me interested in pursuing Public Health or Sociology as a minor.
4. **Asian diversity club leader** (leadership position). I wrote about this role in many of my supplementals, talking about how this club mainly catered to East Asians, so I brought South Asian representation by applying for leadership. We have a couple of meetings per year and we have all-school presentations. This role is a medium time commitment.
5. **Co-founder/leader of a healthcare club** (leadership position). In meetings that happen twice or thrice a month, we educate a small group of students about healthcare in the United States and around the world. We also talk about current events in the medical field such as COVID-19.  This role also made me interested in pursuing Public Health or Sociology as a minor. This role is a huge time commitment.
6. generic leadership position in my school. Not very significant but looks good on my resume
7. generic leadership position in my school. Not very significant but looks good on my resume.
8. **School Literary/Arts Magazine Staffer** for three years.
9. **JV Cross country** for three years (skipped junior year b/c of Covid)
10. **Head lightboard operator for school theatrical productions**. All four years of high school.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Cum Laude Society (top 20% of my class)
2. Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish (school award given to those who take 4 years of language and get a 4 or 5 on the AP exam)
3. Stem Certificate (school award given to those who excel in the STEM classes and complete a related internship or job)
4. AP Scholar
5. generic school award I got during junior year

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor (8/10): I had to fill out a 3-page brag sheet, and my parents also had to fill out a 3-page brag sheet, so I know my counselor had a lot to write about. Additionally, I am pretty involved in the student body, so my counselor knew about me before I even met her.

AP Chem teacher (8.5/10): My AP Chem teacher was my advisor for four years and I did really well in her class, so I was hoping this would be my best letter. However, I know she finished my letter last minute, so I'm worried it wasn't written very well.

English teacher (7.5/10): I really loved my English teacher! She's so sweet and is definitely a great writer. I just wish I developed a closer relationship with her, but it was difficult with being virtual because of Covid-19. Even still, I conversed with her before every class so I think she got to know me pretty well!

**Interviews**

Georgetown (8/10): This interview was only 20 minutes, and more than half of the time was spent asking him questions rather than him asking me questions. However, I think I showed great interest in the school through my questions and answers because Georgetown has been my dream school for many years. And I ended up getting in!

Duke (7/10): This interview lasted for 35 minutes, and he was grilling me with lots of follow-up questions and philosophical stuff. This interview was a little stressful, and I'm worried I may not have answered some of his questions well.

UPenn (9/10): I think this interview was my best! This interview lasted about 45 minutes. My interviewer was so friendly and put me at ease. The interview felt informal and we talked about our personal lives, but I still think I did a great job demonstrating interest in Penn and showing how I would fit in. At the end, my interviewer said he had a lot to write about me.

Harvard (7.5/10): This interview lasted almost an hour. My interviewer was very friendly and we had a good conversation. However, I was really tired, so I think I answered some of her questions really weirdly and she might have been thrown off. And I didn't do as good a job demonstrating interest in Harvard as I did for Penn. I also struggled to talk about my activities and classes in-depth for some reason (I guess I was really tired).

**Essays**

Personal Statement (7.5/10): I wrote about my love for photos and connected this to how I care about my community and self-discovery. My thought process with writing this was that AOs can already see my intelligence through my transcript and test scores, and I can demonstrate interest in my major/school through supplemental essays. My essay also went through many revisions with my tutor and I showed it to my family. A part of me wished I wrote my personal statement about my love for medicine/science, but I think this essay might have worked out because I was truly myself.

Supplementals (8/10): I had at least two revisions for each school. I also had a tutor who helped me with grammar and coherency. I definitely believe that the quality of my supplements increased by the time I was applying to my regular decision schools. However, I was rushing a lot of my RD supplementals towards the end since my dad forced me to apply to so many schools, so I feel like I couldn't spend as much time on them as I wanted to.

**Additional Information:**

Worst year of my life. I went in to this process excited and thought that I would be able to get at least one acceptance that I would be excited about, but it didn't work out. This sub is partially the reason because the survivorship bias is so real, no one is posting massive rejections, which is something to keep in mind as you look around here. Everyday I come back home and hear people getting into amazing colleges and while I'm not jealous, I just wonder why it wasn't me. I guess you can say that I have a lot of regrets about my high school career. Just remember that this process isn't a meritocracy and for one amazing standout acceptance on here there are 50 other similar kids that got rejected, which will help keep it in perspective. Hopefully L season is now over.

EDIT: I had severe extenuating circumstances which I detailed in my app, regarding the condition of a family member and COVID issues as well which were described in my counselor LOR to explain my (lower?)

Acceptances:

* Fordham (dogshit aid)
* Wellesley !!
* Brown !!

**Thoughts:**

i think i got into brown because i had a strong fit. i was a strong applicant but not insane (as shown by all the rejections) so i think what distinguished me from other applicants were my interdisciplinary interests. my ecs and essays all demonstrated my wide reach in art, cs, design, envi sci, etc. and for a school like brown, whose entire schtick is "open curriculum, exploration, blah" i definitely seemed like a student who fit into their exploratory style.

i also think taking advantage of what was provided to me as a woman interested in cs seriously boosted my application. all/most of my cs-based awards and extracurriculars were exclusively available to gender minorities. many companies are doing A LOT to encourage minorities in comp sci so if you are one and are interested in cs... take advantage of it!

finally i would take a step back and chill out a bit. i stressed about college apps too much and lost sleep doom-scrolling/worrying about my apps etc. like it was horrendous how much time i wasted over worrying abt my course rigor just for it all not to matter in the end. now i regret regretting! (wow) and life feels the exact same as it did before except my dad brags about me a little more ig[1, 1, [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 1], 2, 0, 1, 0, 4, 5, 4, 4, 2, 0]**Demographics:** Male, Indian, MA

letters of rec:

compsci teacher (7/10) - taught me 9th and 12th, also my gamedev club advisor so hes known about me from the start. honestly my favorite person in the entire school this man is actually goated <33 like hes the kind of guy that shows kindness through action. mostly talked about leadership ability for club and how i try to support others through my work, also touched on cs skills. just a swell guy fr (also im kinda friends with his daughter lol so maybe bonus points??)

french teacher (6/10) - taught me 9-11th, not the greatest teacher ngl but shes real sweet. kind of person who wants their students to succeed no matter what yk. anyways i actually dropped out of french this year bc of scheduling issues but i think she might actually like me more now üò≠ like rose tinted lenses n all that. mostly talked about how even though ive struggled in the past i always made an active effort to get support and my grades have improved year by year

counselor (6/10) - ok so this makes me mad but i got a new counselor this year which sucked bc id built up like a pretty great relationship with my previous one for like 3 years üò≠ but apparently my old counselor had already written a letter for me so my new one basically just took the same thing and adjusted it to make sense. so if thats true then id say it should be pretty decent. according to my old counselor i was like the only person going over and talking to him on a regular basis so üíÄ

essays: 

def not the best writer out there lol, had to do a ton of revisions for most of them. if it was at least decent, i was pretty happy with it

commonapp (7/10) - talked about my love (its actually more of a love-hate relationship but i didnt mention that lmao) for art and how its shaped my view of the world, from compsci to cooking to my relationships. a little on the generic side but i thought it wasnt bad !

cornell (arts and sciences) (6/10) - mostly talked abt how arts and sciences is a good fit bc its got a really good cs program and also accessible arts/humanities courses. also mentioned clubs and courses in other areas im interested in like art and queer activism. there was a cheesy steve jobs quote in there too üò≠

this one is a little eh, esp with the goofy ass quote in there lmao. i debated for a while but did end up keeping it. i think it did its job for the most part, and thats enough for me

cornell (contribution) (9/10) - a really vivid, detail by detail recounting of one of my sessions caring for my grandmother. ended it by connecting it back to my own definition of what it means to contribute. 

i think i actually cooked with this one !! i really like the step by step description for this, it made me feel kinda absorbed in it yknow? im sure a lot of other people have done similar things but i was still really proud of it !

decisions:

cornell - accepted arts and sciences yippee !!

reflection:

im still kind of shocked tbh üò≠ like i know my stats are v solid but i really didnt think i was gonna get in to cornell for cs, esp since i have like zero competitions and awards whatsoever. the club leadership positions definitely carried my ecs, i still have no idea how i ended up with all of them lmao it just happened. 

anyways im super glad i got in because the rest of my app list was like a bunch of reaches (for cs anyways) and like one safety so i wasnt super confident about my chances with those. feel v fortunate rn that i dont have to spend my break grinding away at supps !!

As said in the title, my school is known as a magnet school, which means they required an application to get in and had more rigorous classes (hence all the honors and AP classes) and multiple classes unique to the campus. The magnet status is the reason that I was allowed to give my weighted GPA for all GPA questions.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Can't believe I forgot about this, but an important detail. In the Fall at Brandeis, I applied to the SEED program (Students Exploring and Embracing Diversity). While I was unable to get a spot, they said my application showed I was hard-working and a good student. They waived my application fee based on this. So I definitely recommend showing interest in schools that you want to go to. That may sound obvious, but documented interest stands out in applications. For example, when Colorado State and Brandeis representatives visited my school, they had people who attended their info session documented so that later on, they could refer back to that list when looking at applications.[1, 2, [0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3, 2, 0], 2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 10, 2, 2, 1, 1]&#x200B;

Academics


  
**GPA:**

* 4.10 Weighted

My GPA is low-ish because my first year of high school was in Mexico, then I transferred to the U.S. for 10th grade, but I wasn't allowed to take any AP or Honors classes. For this reason for my first two years of HS I was not able to take any advanced classes. I explained this in my additional info section. For my second semester junior year I had a 3.96 UW, 4.71 W GPA

Standardized Testing


Went TO

I took the SAT 3 times:


  
1st attempt: 1320

2nd attempt: Collegeboard lost my score. Never trust Collegeboard. Confident that I got around a 1450, but we'll never know. 

3rd attempt: 1410 (Took it in December, so it didn't matter for UChicago anyways)

&#x200B;

I took one practice exam in total and didn't really study for the SAT. I didn't want to spend so much time on an exam that was not going to give me that much in return, and decided to focus more on my personal projects and essays. UChicago does not care nearly as much about the ACT/SAT as other top schools, since they have been test optional since 2018. I don't regret not spending more time on test prep. 

&#x200B;

AP Exams:

&#x200B;

AP United States History (4) (Sent)

AP English Language (3) 

AP Computer Science A (2)

AP Spanish (5) (Sent) (Test Only)

AP French (3) (Sent) (Test Only)

&#x200B;

Yes, I did send a 3 in AP French because I was going to have only 3 years of language in my transcript and on my Junior year I had only taken up to French II because of my situation. Contrary to what people say, I think that if it does not relate to your area of study, a 3 in a subject like French without taking the AP class is still really good. I did want to show that I am close to being trilingual. I also needed to go to the bathroom for the CSA exam so I missed like 2 FRQs. Rip.



  

  
Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): UChicago does not require English exams. I did take the TOEFL in 9th grade in Mexico and scored around a 95, but that was 4 years ago.

Letters of Recommendation

&#x200B;

**Math:** Was really shy in her class and did not talk too much. I did various creative projects in her class and I am certain that I was the person with the highest grade. She knew that I had been on Geometry as a Sophomore and had made a big jump to AP Calculus BC as a senior. I have to admit that she probably did not have a lot of things to talk about me to say something really strong. (6.5/10)

**English:** She had been my teacher for 2 years, really great teacher. I spoke very little English in the first year but for junior year I was able to participate a lot in Socratic Seminars and in class in general. She showed me my Letter of Rec and said something along the lines of "This is the student who has showed the most progress in my class in 17 years of teaching" so it was really strong. (9.5/10)

**Counselor Letter:** I spoke to him maybe 3 times a week for 2 or 3 weeks before turning in my UChicago Application. Saw everything in my application and included things related to me not being able to take APs, Honors and other classes. Said that I had taken the most rigorous coursework in the context of my application. Do not know how strong was it but I am confident I was one of the few, if not the only one to ask him for a letter of recommendation. (8/10)

Essays


  

  
**Personal Statement:** Spent a solid month writing this essay. I talked about a niche topic: countryballs and how they influenced my childhood. Showed a lot of humility, creativity, quirkiness and a bit of vulnerability in this essay. Spent a lot of time searching a topic I was certain I was the only one to write about and that also heavily related to me. I went through my camera roll and remembered that I had been obsessed about countryballs in elementary, so I decided to start writing about them. I was skeptical about this essay because when I presented it to my English teacher she looked confused while reading it, and my counselor's reaction was a bit like "it's good" but didn't have a reaction of like "WOW, THIS ESSAY WILL GET YOU IN". They did laughed at segments that were intended to be humorous, so it worked on that sense. After reading it again, I think it's really good, even though it might seem confusing to some, not because of the writing, but because of the topic. ChatGPT rated it a 95/100.

Rating: (9.25/10)

&#x200B;

**UChicago Uncommon Essay:** Spent the most time on this essay. Chose the prompt of " Due to a series of clerical errors, there is exactly one typo (an extra letter, a removed letter, or an altered letter) in the name of every department at the University of Chicago. Oops! Describe your new intended major." I chose my new major to be "Ant-Thropology", and wrote my essay from the perspective of an ant. Spent a lot of time because I did research on Ants, UChicago, and in general, the essay was long (800 words). My counselor and English teachers did love this one. ChatGPT rated it a 100/100

Rating: (9.5/10)

&#x200B;

**Why UChicago:** Spent the least on this essay but was quick in writing it because I knew exactly why I wanted to go to UChicago. I basically said that UChicago was like Rome in the sense that all paths of knowledge lead to it. Talked about niche programs unique to the college, the historical relationship of Mexico with UChicago, the core, philosophers, the student body, etc... In some parts it did not flow very well and was really long compared to what they recommend (250-500 words). Mine was 750. ChatGPT rated it an 85/100

Rating: (8/10)

Interviews (UChicago Video)

# 


  
UChicago doesn't have interviews, instead there's an optional 2 minute video. I went crazy on this one. I went to the U.S. - Mexico border and wrote an integral on the (Trump) wall, showed 3D models and crafts that I had done in the last couple of years, showed footage of Mexico (which I think helped because I know AOs are not used to seeing footage from my country), and showed a UChicago poster that they had sent me. My video was 2 minutes with 50 seconds long.

In 9th grade I didn't even know what the SAT was or what "AP" or "Honors" meant. I barely spoke English, and when I started researching about the college application process in 11th grade I knew I had to step it up unless I wanted to be left behind. I started cramming and attempted to do what most people do in 3 years in less than a year and a half. I knew I didn't have enough time and decided to convey my college application in a very different way from what it is commonly seen in here. I would always include new information on each part of my application; for example on my essays I never mentioned an activity included in my activity list. Every new detail mentioned would be something very unique to me (For example in my video, I talked for a very brief time in an indigenous language). I knew these kind of details were not common to see and mentioned them throughout my application to reinforce my identity and make me standout. I also used fairly simple language and a straightforward language structure in my essays. It wasn't like the Costco essay where some sentences might come off as pretentious because of the word choice.

**Letters of Recommendation**

APUSH teacher: Read it. It was for the most part very generic. I TA‚Äôd for her and we had a good relationship otherwise.

AP Calculus AB/BC teacher: Didn‚Äôt read, and I don‚Äôt know how it was. He nominated me for said academic award above, and he also cried when I asked him to sign my yearbook the day of graduation. I don‚Äôt know how good of a letter writer he is though; he‚Äôs 81 and didn‚Äôt seem to care much about college applications.

Orchestra conductor: Read it, and without getting into too many details, it was a beautiful letter. I think he was too kind.

Research lab PI: Didn‚Äôt read it. We worked together very closely and I think he had a positive view of me, so I hope the letter reflected that.

**Interviews**

Interviewed at Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, and Northwestern. I‚Äôll leave it at this: I‚Äôm not a particularly good interviewee.

**Essays**

* UC PIQs: My UC app in general was pretty rushed (activity list etc was not great). PIQs were fine, I‚Äôm not a bad writer, but definitely not awesome either. I started the essays during Thanksgiving break.
* Common App: Personal statement was okay. Supplements were also okay (all were written like 2 days before the deadline). I think if I‚Äôd spent more time, I would‚Äôve gotten less waitlists ‚Äî there‚Äôs a lot I would have written differently (and better).

Also, I did NOT have a college counselor and nobody read my essays except for me. I just wanted to make that clear because I‚Äôm sure a LOT of kids posting here did, along with a majority of Ivy admits. Not a bad thing, but it‚Äôs definitely an advantage.
