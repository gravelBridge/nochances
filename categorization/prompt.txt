Note:
This application is sourced from a Reddit forum. If it lacks sufficient information to make a determination, contains clearly false information, or is obviously a joke, output only "0" (without quotes).

CRITICAL:

Only output a list like [], nothing else, no newline characters. DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTARY.
