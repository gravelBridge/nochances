To begin, I’m devastated.

I honestly thought I’d have a better turnout than what I did at present, but 15 straight rejections really took a toll on me. Maybe I’m bad at dealing with failure but I just don’t have any energy left anymore. I just want to know what I did wrong in the process and what I can do for the future.

I applied to:

MIT
UChicago
Miami University in Ohio
Amherst
WashU
Bowdoin
Brown
Haverford
Columbia
Dartmouth
Yale
Harvard
Princeton
Caltech
Johns Hopkins
RIT
St.Olaf

And got rejected from all but Miami University in Ohio. I didn’t even get into the honors program.

Here are my stats:
4.18 WGPA, 3.8UW (Context: I spent the first half of my high school in a school that offered no APs or IBs and so I just had to take what courses I could)
1430 PSAT, National Merit Finalist
34 ACT Superscore
International Student (Living in US but external passport)

APs:
AP Calc BC (5)
AP Lang (5)
AP Stats (5)
AP Chemistry
AP Physics C: M+EM
AP CSP
AP Lit

ECs:
Cross Country and Track (10th Grade)
Volunteered to raise funds and awareness for building a spray park and playground in town square (9-10th Grade)
Peer mentor (9-12th Grade)
Founded two mentoring organizations, one that got 400 members nationwide and one that is district wide to help students affected by COVID 19
Research Internship in Cosmology at my local university under the guidance of a professor
And a few others.

Essays were solid. Had them reviewed multiple times by my counselor + English Teacher. Recs were great too. Managed to get a rec from my prof for my internship too.

I know I’m not that great of a profile but gosh couldn’t I have got something more? The University I am currently accepted in didn’t even let me in their honors program. What happened?
