This obviously hurt my apps cuz EE is more competitive and in hindsight should have applied as a stats/math major.\n\nAcademics\n\nGPA (UW/W): 4.967 / 4 (my school has CRAZY inflation)\n\nRank (or percentile): N/A\n\nNumber of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: AP Phys C: Mech (5 self-study), AP Phys 1 (3), AP Calc AB (5), APCSP (4), APHG (5), AP Chem (took at time of apps got 4 tho), AP Phys C: EM (took at time of apps got 5 tho)\n\nSenior Year Course Load: this is a long one so get ready - AP Chem, AP Phys C: Mech (I had to take it again to get into EM), MVC, Cryptography, Object-Oriented Programming, Film Studies, Percussion, Jazz Band, Large Ensemble, Greek Drama, Server-Side Dev, Operations Research, Lin Alg, Phys C: EM\n\nStandardized Testing\n\nList the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.\n\nSAT: 1440 \\*unreported\\* for all (700RW, 740M) \n\nACT: 35 reported for all - I know I absolutely sold on math despite applying in such a math heavy field, but couldn't care less tbh (35E, 32M, 36R, 35S)\n\nOther (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): none\n\nExtracurriculars/Activities\n\nList all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.\n\n1) Science Olympiad - Member for 9 years; have accumulated 20+ medals from regional to national level, mostly in physics-based events. \n\n2) Ensemble Musician and Multi-instrumentalist - I have played violin, electric bass, double bass, ukulele, and percussion for orchestra, jazz band, choir, and percussion ensemble over 6 years.\n\n3) Founder of Two Math and Physics-Based Forums - Founded forums (which are like group-study classes) with 10+ members each exploring concepts of advanced proof-based calculus and Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, and quantum mechanics. The real analysis forum is actually becoming a real class next year due to the interest it garnered (which I wrote on all my deferral supplement forms)! (The physics forum was meant to be super advanced but our appointed teacher said if you really want to \\*understand\\* anything this semester, just learn something you haven't but at your level, so we ended up doing special relativity). \n\n4) Physics Club President - Organized competitions such as the F=ma and PhysicsBowl, lab tours at state universities, and study sessions for 15+ classmates.\n\n5) Physics Teaching Assistant - Was appointed physics teaching assistant by my school. Tutored my peers during free blocks by explaining concepts, doing example problems, and labs.\n\n6) Flex Member of VEX Robotics Team - Was able to do appointed tasks for the robotics team such as assisting with builds, sorting tools, and debugging code for our robot.\n\n7) Math Club Member and Competitor - Participated in competitions such as the Duke Math Meet, AMC, and Integral Bee. I was able to learn a lot of tricks and improve my math skills. (I did not win any of these)\n\n8) YouTube - Uploading variety content like gaming, music, and math since 2016. Improved editing, recording, and scripting skills.\n\n9) Table Tennis - Hosted in-school tournaments with friends. Improved my game over time. In process of building a website that tracks rankings within the school. (Did not end up happening, unfortunately because of my class load and someone else trying to fork off the idea but no one wanted to use the website to track rankings to begin with). \n\n10) Food Pantry Organizer - Packed and sorted 1000s of lunch bags with other peers to be sent to different organizations that would donate them to underprivileged neighborhoods.\n\nAwards/Honors\n\nList all awards and honors submitted on your application.\n\n1) The southeast has a thing called \"Math and Science Schools\" which are very selective residential schools and have an application to accept people with a good background in STEM. I got accepted into this and put it as an honor. This is very competitive to get into and there is even more competition at the school, especially for college apps if they compare you with other members from your school.\n\n2) Science Olympiad States - 1st Place in an event.\n\n3) VEX Robotics States - Runner-ups in bracket\n\n4) Science Olympiad States - 6th Place in 2 other events.\n\n5) AP Scholar with Distinction\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nPhysics teacher - 10/10, knew me very well, also sponsored the club I was in. We got along really nicely, and we are so chill, like our emails are like 2 sentences and involve thumbs-up emojis instead of words.\n\nMusic teacher - 8/10, he knew I was hard-working and passionate about things I set my mind to. I started out as a violin player but switched to electric bass (and a bit of double bass), with no prior experience. I was the worst one in the band but worked twice as hard to bridge that gap, so this was probably what he wrote about on the rec, but I am not sure. I just like exploring new topics and instruments, I recently picked up percussion stuff, too.\n\nEnglish teacher - ?/10, he knew me but not to the level of the other two. I don't know his opinions of me at all, and what he thinks about me. I did good in his class, and got good grades on writing assignments, maybe participated a bit in discussions, but that's about it. If it didn't require an English LoR (looking at you MIT), I didn't send his in. I only sent it in when you could submit more than 2 (as optional ones).\n\nInterviews\n\nMIT Interview - 2/10: my interviewer had the exact same background in what all my ECs were (like events in Science Olympiad or robotics), but she had a masters in the subjects whereas I was a high schooler with random accumulated facts in no sequential order, so she could catch onto BS and superficial understanding more. Also, my first interview ever so unfortunately fumbled.\n\nDuke Interviews - 9/10: this guy was very chill and had the exact same background and interest as I have! He was doing EE and was currently in the fintech sector, and that's kind of my goal, too, so we got along very well, and he acted as a nice mentor for an hour and told me more about his career and story.\n\nEssays\n\nI had no clue what to write my essay on for the longest time, so after reading tons of collegeessayguy and stuff, decided to write a \"montage essay\" on \"instruments\" I have amassed in my repertoire over the years. I started off writing about toys, then real instruments, and kind of tied them into how they reflected the state of my life and personality at that moment in time when I was learning them. I then went full-circle and ended with a table and wrote that anything can be an instrument in the right hands, because it's all up to the creativity of the individual, much like how toys were instruments when I was little, rhythmically banging on objects at different angles can act like a drum set.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAcceptances:\n\nState Safety (EA), I also applied to a full-ride scholarship here and got it.\n\nPurdue **with a Presidential Scholarship** of 10k/year (EA), I don't know how I got this at all to be honest. I was expecting the Purdue acceptance (only one I had hope for), but *with* a scholarship I didn't even apply for is absolutely crazy. I took it as a sign that they knew they were the best I would get and really wanted me to go to their school.\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology (EA -> Deferred -> Accepted), I wasn't expecting this at all to be honest considering how I applied EE and how competitive it is there. After looking at the ECs my friends had at my school, I was just hoping I got into my state safety and Purdue to be honest, and had no hopes of anything else.\n\nDUKE (RD), LETS GOOOOOOOOO I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE HOW THIS HAPPENED BUT I AM SO HAPPY, like I said after reading a lot of the things my friends had and even people on this subreddit or a2c applying to these types of schools, I had 0 hope. I am going to attend this Fall.\n\nWaitlists:\n\nUniversity of California San Diego (RD they don't have EA)\n\nUniversity of Michigan Ann-Arbor (EA -> Postpone -> Waitlist -> Rejected), at least I put a tough fight and literally made them read my application 3-4 times. I took it in a positive funny way, as in, it's always fun wasting admission officer's time just like how they waste ours with this shitty format. \n\nRejections:\n\nMIT (RD)\n\nUC Berkeley (RD)\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nIf I knew what I wanted to do a bit sooner, I think I might have had a better chance with UM or UCSD. I did some self-reflection, realized I didn't like building things that much, and have always liked math more than actual hands-on things, which is why industrial engineering or applied math and stats would be better fit for me. These majors are way less competitive (because people think they don't have job prospects, I don't know?), so I might have had a better shot.\n\nAnyway, to those that don't have that cracked of a resume, you can do it guys! I have absolutely no clue how a miracle like me getting into Duke or GTech happened, with such normal ECs. All my ECs are very achievable by the \\*average\\* student, and actually a lot of people reading this probably have better or same-caliber ECs than me with like 1000 service hours, shadowing doctors, interning at NASA, and having some crazy research. I didn't have any of this or any cracked talents and went to a school where this stuff was pretty common. I struggled listing 10 EC's I could have put there, and 5 awards, which is why I had to put SciOly states twice, AP Scholar, table tennis, and YouTube. I didn't even have a \"spike\" in my application, like I had a lot of math and physics and music things, but didn't have an award, like AIME qual, or USAPhO qual, or all-state orchestra, in any of them. \n\nI think my strongest part of the application was the course rigor. As you could see by my senior courses, it was a lot (14?). In junior year, I had almost the same amount. I was also in every music program at my school (except choir and piano), so I basically had 0 time in the evenings, night would be for homework and stuff, and then the rest of the night would be for having fun w/ friends and sleeping at 3AM. I think colleges noticed this, and in my deferral forms and everything I put classes I had added to my list as a desperate last attempt to get in.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's just about how you present yourself, I guess. I don't consider myself \"worse\" or \"better\" than those that had more or better EC's than me, because I enjoyed my life playing video games and talking to friends. **Also, your extracurriculars don't dictate how smart you are.** I know plenty of people at my school who are way worse than me at a lot of subjects but have crazy LinkedIn profiles bigger than most adults in the workforce for 30 years. Everyone has things they are good at, don't feel inferior to others, **ever**. Especially over something so stupid like extracurriculars.\n\nI have realized that where you are from plays a much bigger role in your applications than any other factor. My friends that went to a different (more) competitive school with similar or MORE ECs and stats got rejected from almost everywhere. I feel so sorry for bay area kids and those in similar regions of sweatiness, but it is what it is. Which leads me to my last point.\n\nOn a final note, I hate the American system, and if it was up to me, I would have a real college entrance exam (the SAT and ACT don't mean anything) like they do in Asia, especially for colleges *known* for their engineering, physics, or math programs. Kids shouldn't have to force themselves to do superficial stuff like \"shadowing doctors\" and \"researching\" to get into university, especially when 99% of it is all BS to try to get in. I hope to live to the day where collegeboard monopoly falls and colleges start administering their own entrance exams.\n\nAlso, MIT and UCB were dream schools when I was little, but I already knew it wasn't happening by the time I reached junior year, so I abandoned the dream. Overall, just don't have dream schools and you won't be disappointed, instead look at where you got and be happy, like me. Where you go for undergrad doesn't mean anything, because everyone's going to end up at some old desk job and we will all be corpo slaves for some company at the end of the day."

In addition, I learned from my mistakes in my First Year cycle and adjusted my new essays accordingly. I wrote about why I wanted to transfer, and supplementals about how I overcame my childhood speech delays, losing weight during Boxing Club, my experiences as the team manager, etc. It is worth noting, however, that the schools that accepted me during the transfer cycle only had one essay, while the ones that rejected me had two or more.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UIUC Grainger CS (COMMITTED!)\n* Johns Hopkins\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* None\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UC Berkeley EECS\n* UCLA CSE\n* Carnegie Mellon\n* Cornell\u00a0\n* Georgia Tech\n* Duke\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI was obviously overjoyed that I got both UIUC CS and JHU acceptances, as I went into the transfer cycle knowing that going 0 for 8 was a very likely possibility, especially with how competitive Computer Science is nowadays.

Going to UIUC CS, however, in the grand scheme of things, is just another step forward, as my journey, both in Computer Science and life, has only just begun. "

Archery (competed nationally, rangemaster/assist coaches at range, founding member of JOAD club, a slew of 1st/2nd places at regional tournaments. 10 hours/week)\n2. Speech & Debate (congressional debate + informative speaking, lettered varsity and \u201cdebate mom\u201d, competed at state in Congress, nothing really high impact. 6 hours/week during tournament season).\n3. Community service club vice president (organized a lot of events, this club has also existed for 5+ years, put around 5 hours/week into this).\n4. Math team (local competitions, minor awards, tutoring, etc. 4 hours/week).\n5. GSA club (officer, four year member, helped lead projects that got the club involved with the school and greater community. Led walkout after a *bad* incident of homophobia took place at our school. 2 hours/week).\n6. Foreign language learning (mainly Spanish, German, and Polish, 7 hours/week outside of school throughout the year; this is pretty leisurely for me).\n7. Chemistry club treasurer/founding member (club only lasted a year as the supervisor got too busy for it; we drew up actual lab proposals and gathered the supplies to complete them, lots of time spent researching. As treasurer, I organized several fundraisers, managed club funds, and approved/made all purchases).\n8. Art stuffs (lots of drawing and painting, never entered any contests though I did submit a portfolio to every college that would take them. Varies significantly, averages to 2 hours/week).\n9. Other volunteering activity (16 hours/week over the summer)\n10. Random club that didn\u2019t do much, technically a founding member (pretty much filler; 1 hour/week).\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. Poetry contest winner (national)\n2. Scholarship winner (regional)\n3. Seal of Biliteracy (Spanish)\n4. AP Scholar w/ Distinction\n5. National Honor Society\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nEnglish teacher, 9/10. We got along great and she adored my writing (used my essays most of the time when showing examples), read the letter and it felt pretty glowing.\n\nChemistry teacher, 8/10. Again, got along great with her and I was definitely an over-achiever in her class. Didn\u2019t get to read it and she isn\u2019t the strongest of writers, so 8/10 is a solid guess.\n\nHistory teacher, 6/10. We got along great, he openly brags about me, however he used the same recommendation outline that he used for a student last year. Granted, that student got into Notre Dame, but wasn\u2019t nearly as personalized.\n\nSpanish teacher, 7.5/10. I\u2019m one of her standouts and we know each other quite well, been to her house for a barbecue before. Read the letter and it wasn\u2019t as glowing as my English teacher\u2019s, *but* it highlighted a lot of achievements that I couldn\u2019t put elsewhere in my application. Content was great, wording/tone had room to improve.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nBryn Mawr, 2/10. My interviewer and I were not vibing, I was incredibly nervous, and after I consoled myself over how I just blew my chances of admission to a hard target-ish school that I really liked.\n\nMount Holyoke, 9/10. Aside from a little misunderstanding that I didn\u2019t correct, we ~vibed~. Loved my interviewer, she made me want to attend more than I had wanted to before the interview!\n\nSwarthmore, 7/10. Mostly vibed, but we didn\u2019t have the same click I had with other interviewers. Good interview and conversation.\n\nPrinceton, 9/10. Interviewer was a super cool guy and we had an awesome conversation. Their interviews aren\u2019t used in the admissions process, however, so I just appreciated it for what it was.\n\nMIT, 0/10. Hated my interviewer who was a sexist mfer, came very close to leaving the call early. Made many backhanded comments about women at MIT, my major, my city, and even MIT in general. Very much a self-important dude bro, made me regret applying to MIT in general. If I\u2019d been admitted, he gave me such an ick that I genuinely wouldn\u2019t have attended.\n\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement was probably the best essay I wrote throughout the cycle. Spent 20+ hours on it and revised a lot between November and January. It was about my speech impediment and debate, a story which my debate coach found very inspirational.\n\nMy essays for Georgia Tech were heavily targeting their mission statement in how I framed everything. After submitting, I felt incredibly confident about my admission. Spent maybe 5 hours total on this application.\n\nOther supplements were largely done the day of the deadline and very rushed, though quality was still fairly high. I write best under a deadline, which unfortunately does jive overly well with being proactive about college applications.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Washington State University (rolling, $4K/year merit)\n* Agnes Scott College (EA1, $30K/year merit + invited to compete for full ride)\n* Georgia Tech (EA2, Dean\u2019s Scholarship/OOS tuition waiver, valued around $22K/year IIRC).\n* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (EA, some $43.5K in merit)\n* Bryn Mawr (RD, $45K/year presidential scholarship; this one surprised me after the interview!)\n* Mount Holyoke (RD, $30K/year 21st century scholarship)\n* University of Washington (RD, Honors College, direct admit to major)\n* Vassar College (RD, COA was $20K/year after need-based aid)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Williams College -> ACCEPTED, ATTENDING \n* Carleton College -> ACCEPTED\n* Harvey Mudd (technically still waitlisted, but we\u2019ll call this a rejection. I was unable to interview, which I feel contributed to this outcome)\n\n*Rejections:*\n* UChicago (ED; self-sabotaged essays, was happy about this in the end due to COA)\n* Caltech (RD; attended their fly-in Caltech Up Close but was very straight up with AOs that I\u2019d much rather attend for grad school)\n* MIT (RD; let out a sigh of relief that I wouldn\u2019t feel pressured to attend if the impossible had happened. Slightly disappointed that I couldn\u2019t refuse to attend out of spite).\n* Swarthmore (RD; essays were admittedly choppy in how they read due to the grammar structure I used, only LAC to outright reject me).\n* Emory (RD; essays were so bad and literally only applied for a chance at a scholarship)\n* Vanderbilt (RD; essays were just as trashy as Emory\u2019s, also applied primarily in the hopes of a scholarship).\n* Princeton (RD; felt strong about this application but knew it was a shot in the dark. My school has had many Ivy acceptances over the past ten years or so, but never at Princeton or Yale).\n\n**Additional information**\nAs decision days drew near and while I was waitlisted, I sent in quite a few updates. I placed highly at debate state championships, did exceptionally well at math regionals, and earned recognition awards in science, debate, and Spanish, which are only awarded to the top student in each subject. Interestingly, Harvard guy didn\u2019t get a single department award, of which there were over 20 with ECs and specialized pathways.\n\nHearing back from Williams was a surprise (in truth, I\u2019d written off all of my waitlists as soft rejections), but I didn\u2019t care much at first. Admitted? Neat, probably couldn\u2019t afford it. When I saw my financial aid, however, I blue screened and thought there had been a mistake. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for how everything turned out, even though my imposter syndrome is now trying to convince me that Williams can\u2019t be *that* good of a school if I were admitted. I was admitted to Carleton a week later, though my Williams acceptance certainly tempered my enthusiasm for Carleton! Though I remain a little nervous having not visited Williams before, I look forward to starting college this fall."

Percussion Sub for San Jose Wind Symphony (performed under SJSU\u2019s conductor with adult musicians) \n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\nbtw my main ones were both from teachers i had in 10th grade. sure it might look better they were 11th grade teachers, buuuuuuut i just wasn\u2019t as close to them\n\nSchool Counselor 6/10: i mean i just gave her a cover letter, but it was probably better than others since i talked to her about some stuff before + she wrote me a letter in 10th grade for a summer program i got accepted to so \n\nEnglish 10 Honors/TA Teacher 9.89/10: LOVE HER TO DEATH THE GOAT; participated a lot in 10th grade and regularly visited to chat in 11th grade about life and writing and stuff. HOWEVER i think if she wrote me the letter after i TAed for her second sem it would\u2019ve been a 20/10 cuz i was really good TA and that would\u2019ve boosted it a lot more. Example she got really really sick for a couple weeks so i basically covered her lessons/lectures/grading/sub stuff for her to the point that the office was like begging me to come back after i graduated and help LOL \n\n10th Grade Math Teacher 8.5/10: honestly wasn\u2019t as close to him as i could\u2019ve been/would\u2019ve been if i had him when i was older, i was a pretty good student/participated in 10th tho and then just kept visiting in 11th to yap. he also runs like a 3d printing lab at my school so i reached out to him about our school lit mag and we bonded a lot then about art and how rough life was.\n\n(extra) 11th Grade English Teacher 7/10: asked cuz one school needed an 11th grade teacher. I was one of the only few who actually participated in their class and we talked a bit outside esp since they started coincidentally getting involved in my ecs in senior year. it wasn\u2019t very\u2026 natural though id say LOL. like we both liked each other but it was clear our convo was more on the forced side rather than jokey jokey. still great though and better than my other 11th grade teachers !\n\n(extra) Mentor for my Poetry Group (12/10): He actually offered to send it to me to read but I declined at the time cuz I was scared colleges would somehow find out oops. I have no doubt though it was amazing. we\u2019d just spent like a month together every day doing writing and poetry, and he trained me a lot in exploring poetry (specifically slam) and yeah love him :D \n\n**Interviews**\n\nGeorgetown (irl) 6/10: longest one I had but it was done like right towards the end of app season LOL so i was definitely not doing the best mentally and socially at the time. most of the convo was just me asking her questions about georgetown, her own life, etc. etc. we bonded a lot over being humanities nerds in the bay area but convo def was starting to fall dry at the 40 min mark and i just downplayed/felt really unsure about anything i was doing\n\nNorthwestern (irl) 8/10: ok this interview was really weird lol. first we were alr on a time limit since I had to get to a mock trial competition in 30 min oops. second i feel like all the northwestern interviewers make it their goal to be as least conversational as possible? like girl would just reply ok to my response and immediately ask the next one LOL which sure we were on time limit but not *that* tight. i wish i was a bit more quirky/showed more personality during this BUT i think it was pretty good since by the end i finally got a convo out of her so yay! (also yes i absolutely slayed the mock trial round right after even though i had to call out the other team on rule breaking thanks for asking) \n\nUPenn (online) 7/10: pretty good at the beginning but fell so flat towards the end \u2014 mainly because i think we both realized halfway through penn really does not fit me at all LMAOOO. loved my interviewer though she was so nice and we did hit it off, i just thought she\u2019d like\u2026 end it the minute convo was getting dry. but she didn\u2019t so there\u2019d just be long periods where we\u2019d sit there in silence HELP. i also think i rambled a bit too much in sections since i thought i had more of a chance at penn after going to their summer program so i was like \u201cyo can u also tell the AOs xyzxyzxyz\u201d \n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App 8.5/10: my topic was executed really well but sosososo generic. wrote about falling out of love with piano and how that led me to realize i had passion for all my other activities instead. added lots of cool creative writing twists that showed off my personality/depth of thought to compensate. \nExample: I opened by comparing the piece and me messing it up to the slapstick of Tom & Jerry; added narrative flow with some dialogue and imagery from my teacher; reflected on the shame I thought I\u2019d bring to my asian grandparents (who thought i was a piano god and was gonna play in carnegie for some reason); ended with declaring that i\u2019m more than just a pianist telling the story of tom and jerry\u2019s escapades, but also a etc. etc. etc. related to my other stuff yay! \n\nSupps 9.5/10: ate. even reading back months later i only hate like 2 of them. overall helped me show all the impact I really had in my clubs, my communities and also how hard it was to balance all that out with the coinciding stupid drama and my schoolwork. huge props to my editor for helping me so much with them all. obviously i recycled like 4-5 by the end, but I tried to keep each one as fun and unique as possible regardless of word count. \nExample: UChicago whyus i took on the perspective of an ivy plant to explore the university; wrote two essays about Minecraft LOL (specifically the upenn thank you letter to a recently passed youtuber); UCs I tried to tell as many stories as i possibly could and had this whole epiphany about the power of voice and its link to all my ecs; finally with whymajor i had a long and short version, long was this whole setup of a pen drop i did at my plenary speaker speech; short one i opened by talking about costco LMAO\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)** (Reddit hates me sorry for wonky format)\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n>!University of Pittsburgh (rolling)!<\n\n>!Case Western Reserve EA (32k scholarship + personal P.S. on acceptance lmao?? idk if they do that for all)!<\n\n>!Boston University (guaranteed transfer offer)!< \n\n>!UC Merced!<\n\n>!UC Riverside!<\n\n>!UCSC early acceptance!<\n\n>!UC Davis!<\n\n>!UC San Diego!<\n\n>!UC Berkeley !!<\n\n>!Northwestern Medill School of Journalism!!!!

I hope this post provides hope to strong musicians with low stats who, despite not necessarily wanting to pursue a career as a professional musician, can use their artistic accomplishments to stand out in T20 applications alongside a second major. I'll be studying music performance and economics at Vanderbilt this fall!\n\nWilling to answer questions and offer advice to anybody considering music school and the audition process. Best of luck!"

Award for outstanding service to the school. \n\n3. International Examinations Board, Outstanding Achiever. \n\n4. Recognition award for finishing with the highest academic aggregate in the school's history. \n\n*Essays:*\n\nPersonal essay was about my love for pretzels and whipped cream. Rest of essays were about why I want to study Maths or CS and what I hope to achieve in the future. I just went into depth about my future research and career plans. Nothing too fancy or quirky, I'm not the best writer.\n\nEuropean Uni personal statements were just me explaining why I want to study Maths.\n\n*Letters of Recommendation:*\n\nCounselor (Headmaster of School) - 10/10. He pretty much sang praises about my work ethic and extracurricular involvement. \n\nMaths Teacher - 8/10. chatGPT'd it out of laziness so I had to rewrite a letter for her and she signed it off and submitted it. \n\nProgramming Teacher - 6/10. chatGPT'd it and wouldn't let me change the content. Scrapped his letter. \n\nEnglish Teacher - 11/10!! She actually discussed the motor vehicle software that I developed in the letter which was really sweet. \n\nManager at Internship - 9/10. Really had positive things to say about my character, always showing up to work early etc. \n\n*Interviews:*\n\nMIT - My first interview. Interviewer seemed uninterested, but we talked a lot about my experience working as a programmer and if I would continue the same at MIT. 6/10. \n\nStanford - Went pretty badly. The interviewer was a journalist by profession, so I got grilled. She ended the interview 15 minutes early. 4/10. \n\nHarvard - Went amazing. Interviewed in person at a coffee shop in a nearby city which was nice. We just talked about what Harvard is like and what I should expect. I told her all about myself as well. 11/10. \n\nYale - Went okay I guess, but the video call kept being choppy. The power in my area also went off midway through the interview. Welcome to Africa. 6/10. \n\nDartmouth - Interviewer never showed up for the call. 2/10 \n\nOxford - I mean the questions were pretty rough. The interviewer jumped right into the technical jazz from the onset, to test how much I actually knew about Maths. 5/10. \n\nETH Zurich - Similarly bad. 5/10. \n\n*Admission Results:*\n\nEuropean Uni Results: \n\nUniversity of Oxford - Accepted \n\nETH Zurich - Accepted \n\nImperial College London - Denied \n\nUniversity of St. Andrew's - Accepted \n\nUniversity College London - Denied \n\nPolytechnic Institude of Paris - Accepted \n\nI failed to get scholarships for European study, so none of these were a viable option unfortunately. \n\n*Early Decision:*\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology(EA) - Deferred \n\n\n*Regular Round:*\n\nBowdoin College - Denied \n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology - Denied \n\nYale College - Denied \n\nPrinceton University - Waitlisted.\u00a0 Accepted place on waitlist. \n\nHarvard College - Accepted. $5k EFC \n\nDartmouth College - Accepted. $7k EFC \n\nBrown University - Denied \n\nColumbia University - Denied \n\nCornell University - Denied \n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania - Waitlisted. Declined waitlist. \n\nSwarthmore College - Denied \n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology - Accepted. $8k EFC. \n\nAmherst College - Denied \n\nNorthwestern University - Denied \n\nDuke University - Denied \n\nStanford University - Waitlisted. Accepted place on waitlist.\n\n\n*Waitlist Outcomes:* \n\nStanford University - Denied \n\nPrinceton University - I received a call located in New Jersey, USA. Hmm, that's weird, I thought. I answered the phone call and I was greeted by a lady that said she works at Princeton University's admissions office. She informed me on the call that my file had been reviewed a second time, and that I had been admitted to Princeton off the waitlist. Later on, the acceptance and financial aid letters came. It was pretty damn close to a full ride. \n\nSo with that being said, it looks like I'll be joining Princeton University's class of 2028 this fall. Go Tigers! \ud83d\udc05 \ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udd0d \n\nI really like what Princeton has to offer in terms of strength in technical subjects, they were the best for Maths and CS. They also gave me the most aid and that was a huge factor. I simply couldn't turn down going there almost for free. \n\nWell. That's my story guys. The US application process was extremely painful for me, but it worked out in the end. Good luck to you all on your college journey :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I got a D in the class, but I raised it from like a 40%. I struggled a lot, but she saw me trying. I met with her and peer tutors and worked really hard for that D. I had her for Algebra and got an A in that class and helped peers work so that helped a lot. Needless to say, I did not take Calculus senior year LOL (8/10)\n\nAP Comparative Government and Politics Teacher. Pretty average, I never really stood out much. I needed a non-stem recommendation from a jr. year teacher. (7/10)\n\n**Interviews**\n\nInterviewed at Harvard, did not get in.\n\nInterviewed at Holy Cross, wait listed.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI wrote about a serious, life-threatening medical procedure, my recovery, and how it changed my outlook on life.

There was only one year where I did not get 4.0Ws.  I took honors classes every year besides Freshman, 3 APs, 13 Honors, and tried to make classes manageable for me senior year. I absolutely hate math and science classes that involve math. I got all As, Bs, and 1 D when I applied. I prioritized extracurriculars and being able to sleep and still do things I enjoyed over getting perfect grades. I was totally myself in my essays, and I think that helped me shine through. I did not spend much time on any of my essays except my personal statement. Most essays were done 1 hour before they were due. I didn't have a 'dream school'. My mindset was just to apply to the best schools and see where I get in, then decide which one I like best.\n\nThroughout the process, I was never really stressed. I go to University of Michigan and it feels like home, I couldn't be happier!!!\n\nedit: i took challenging and unique courses, i actually have a personality outside getting top grades/scores and stressing, i did extracurriculars i was actually passionate about, i worked hard, i had good recommendations, i had good essays, i focused on myself and what i can control rather than comparing myself to others and bragging. college applications are a culmination of a lot of things. having perfect grades or test scores isn't as important as you may think.\n\nalso, dm me if you ever want application tips or essay review, my essays were all really good and helped me a lot."

It went well, don't think it added much to my application though.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Essay (8/10): Wrote about how I make spreadsheets for everything as a common thread to talk about my love of information and some of my interests (used weightlifting, football, and movies). I was proud of it but depending on the reader it could have come off as slightly convoluted. Had multiple essay coaches proofread and make tweaks, which helped a lot.\n\nSupplemental Essays (7/10): I worked with an essay coach for all of my RD schools, but only had my parents proofread my early schools. Leaned into my Italian heritage for a lot of them, and leaned into being a Catholic for the Catholic schools. Our community floods frequently, so I talked about how I help out the community during cleanup periods for any of the service essays. The early essays suffered from not having a coach at the time, but overall the supplements were pretty good.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n* UNC Chapel Hill (EA) - >!Rejected!<\n* University of Virginia (EA) - >!Rejected!<\n* University of Maryland (EA) - >!Accepted to College Park Scholars w/$8000 per year Presidential Scholarship!<\n* Villanova (EA) - >!Accepted!<\n* Notre Dame (RD) - >!Rejected!<\n* Northwestern (RD) - >!Rejected!<\n* Vanderbilt (RD) - >!Rejected!<\n* Cornell (RD) - >!Rejected!<\n* Brown (RD) - >!Rejected!<\n* University of Michigan (EA) - >!Deferred --> Waitlisted --> Rejected!<\n* Duke (ED) - >!Deferred --> Rejected!<\n* UConn (RD) - >!Accepted to Honors Program w/$23,000 per year Scholarship!<\n* Purdue (RD) - >!Accepted!<\n* Boston College (RD) - >!Accepted + Committed!!<"

I managed to get all A's through regular courses until senior year, I challenged myself with 4 AP classes and self studied 1. I got all A's and received a 4.56 GPA 1st semester or senior year. That is what colleges want, they want you to continue to keep pushing yourself, so I do not recommend slacking senior year. Also, I had no idea what I wanted to do until Jr. year because of honors physics. It made me love stem and showed me I was good at it. If anyone wants to read my essays pm me.

I was honestly so in shock bc he and his wife were both harvard law grads but we bonded over our love for nature and languages. it was a nice interview but we somehow agreed on meeting up in berkeley and one point there was a security guard chasing someone out of the store next to us. violently... \n\n**Essays**\n\ni poured my soul into these essays lmao. started writing after junior year aps, wrote about things rly important and genuine to me. since i wasn't applying stem at the time, i talked a lot about crochet & languages (this was my personal statement) and one of my favorite essays was about moving in to college and bonding w multicultural roommates over my love for cooking dumplings (and how this recipe was passed down through the women in my family). such a grammar fanatic in actual writing not text lol so edited for content or grammar sooooo many times. also talked abt my hopes and dreams as an archaeological linguist to restore the manchurian language (language of the rulers of the qing dynasty). maybe talked abt being chinese too much in this post-covid era lol... but i feel like i emphasized enough the american part of it but rly dk\n\nmy college counselors said they never saw such college essay-y college essays on the first try. my ap lit teacher also had a 1-on-1 essay review session w/ me (she was amazing too) and rly liked my personal statement, but might have been biased cuz she used to be in a similar field. \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UCSD (committed)\n* UCD\n* UCSC\n* UMass Amherst EA w/ scholarship\n* UIUC EA\n* Tsinghua (full scholarship but didn't end up going)\n* Peking\n* Northeastern EA(?)\n* Duke Kunshan lol\n* UCR\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* CMU waitlist -> accept (I then rejected it bc of time constraints/sunk-cost fallacy T\\_T)\n* Cal (but didn't write love letter or anything)\n* Wellesley (didn't bother)\n* prolly like ucsb or uci or both, I honestly don't remember/care but either got wl/accept\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT EA defer -> reject\n* Harvard\n* Stanford\n* Princeton\n* UCLA\n* UPenn\n* Brown\n* Dartmouth\n* Duke\n* USC EA\n* Pomona\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nco 23 so affirmative action was still in place - don't tell me it wouldn't have affected me cuz my hs's co 24 had much much better acceptances even w/ fewer results in usapho/usamo/usaco etc. \n\nyes it did take me over a year to get over these acceptances. mostly bc the grass is always greener on the other side and i went in-state instead of private T_T \n\nhurr hurr UCSD isn't that bad... im already a senior now and will b done w/ my first degree in 2 yrs total and double major + minor w ill take 3 yrs. it's still vaguely computational, saves a lot of money, doesn't take any effort to maintain that gpa, and i can still go to my dream school cuz im applying to grad school (soon). ucsd's data science program is also great. if i went back in time and could choose again though, i would probably go to cmu and do their stats-ml program. part of that is cuz at least i would have the same breaks and be in the timezone as my bf of 7 mf years. also cuz prestige does matter. ucsd is not a bad school by all means, but it still doesn't sound as good to tech companies as cmu. money wasn't ever really an issue, but eldest asian daughter vibes had me choosing duty over prestige or watever. anyways its perfectly fine to feel upset for a long time abt stuff like this, but you will end up loving wherever you end up (and if you don't, transfers are always a thing!) good luck and best wishes to everyone hehe"

Dean's Honors List\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nOrganic Chemistry professor \u2013 10/10, he said I would bawl if I read his letter.\n\nWriting seminar professor \u2013 7/10, we were close but kinda drifted after the first year which is when I took his class.\n\nAnother writing seminar professor \u2013 8/10, we were a bit closer and I participated a LOT in her class.\n\nResearch PI \u2013 5/10, she has a lot to say about me but we never really talked since I mainly work with her postdocs... but I figured I should put her letter in.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI received no requests for interviews.\n\n**Essays**\n\nSo I worked with a transfer advisor this cycle, and he helped a ton with my essays. My \"personal statement\" (which is the \"why transfer?\" essay) was about why I was inspired by chemistry, why I wanted to transfer (duh), and what I want to achieve with research. Some of my supplemental essays were about my love for medicine, my identity, and some volunteering experiences.\n\n8/10 overall in my opinion. This rating might have been higher if I didn't start working on my applications two weeks before the deadlines.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UPenn (committed)\n* Johns Hopkins\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* None\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Harvard\n* Brown\n* Columbia\n* MIT\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nDefinitely feel a lot better about this cycle. Brown is need aware for transfer applicants, so I didn't expect to get in there. Harvard and MIT were crazy reaches, but the MIT rejection was sad... and Columbia is Columbia.\n\nExcited for UPenn! I was in such a dilemma between UPenn and JHU (since they both gave comparable financial aid packages), but I felt a bit better with UPenn. And I think that's what it came down to in the end: it was a gut feeling."

The cost will be similar per year (within \\~$8000 of each other), which is not a huge factor for me, and I am only going for two or three years since I am a transfer student. I am curious what the long term-tech career opportunities would be like -- seems like short-term UW gets the advantage since it is in Seattle. Which would you choose specifically for that factor (excluding things like social life, weather, food, campus, etc.)?\n\nSeems difficult to pass on UMich since it is overall the better school, whereas UW is kind of a one trick pony with CS, but maybe that doesn't matter?\n\nI would like to work in SF / Bay Area after graduating. For those from that region, how is the CS brand name between these two options perceived down there?"

Pre-University Music scholarship, 1 of 12 recipients nationally\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nGood relationship with teachers and counsellor who provided LORs, but as my school rarely sends people to US universities, I have a feeling that the LORs weren't written in the style that US college AOs prefer, since my recommenders were probably unfamiliar with the style of writing and weren't given as much guidance for this (I don't blame them though, I'm still really grateful for them agreeing to help!)\n\n7/10\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interviews**\n\nHad a great experience for all 3 interviews I got (Princeton, Stanford, UPenn Huntsman), where we had very lively conversations about personal life and understanding more about the university! My Princeton interviewer had a good 1h debate on macroeconomics during our interview (that sidetracked very heavily from the interview itself!) Definitely the highlight of the college admissions process, got to know many amazing and accomplished alumni of the schools.\n\n9/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nTook 4 months to draft, re-draft and re-draft all the US essays! As someone who really didn't read much fiction books growing up and brought up in an education system that prioritised a very different style of writing for similar higher education opportunities (I was far more well-versed in the UK-style personal statement writing), I wasn't very good in writing in the flowery manner of the US common apps, and I grew better at it over time. Gave me a great chance to reflect on my personal story and growth over my high school and post-high-school experience. I still feel that my final essays turned out a bit too cold in terms of the writing, but I'm just happy that I gave it my best shot.\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Oxford PPE\n* UPenn RD (Wharton and College of Arts & Sciences) (Huntsman Program for International Studies and Business - Japanese target) --> Committed!\n* University College London PPE\n* University of Warwick PPE\n* University of St Andrews Economics and International Relations\n* National University of Singapore Law and Economics Double Degree Programme\n\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Nil\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Stanford REA (Deferred --> Rejected) (Honestly, should have applied RD. The essays I submitted to Stanford weren't the best, and I could have used the extra few months to polish it up)\n* Harvard RD\n* Princeton RD\n* Yale RD\n* MIT RD\n* Columbia RD\n* London School of Economics PPE\n\nNote: I only applied for reach schools in the US as I still had 1 year in my military service. Essentially, it's a forced gap year, so even if I didn't get into any college, I could just apply again in the following cycle.\n\n**Additional Information:**\nElaborated on smaller extracurriculars and scholarship coverage details\n\n\nOne of the things that I felt helped me with my application was that I had received an Econs/business and finance-related scholarship despite not taking Econs in school (in the A-Levels system,  a vast majority of ~90% of students take Economics and I was one of the only students in my school not to do so), and with a clear narrative and financial aid sorted out, it really did help me through the process.\n\nIn the end, what worked for the 1 US school I got into was that my narrative of wanting to contribute back to SG through my field of work in my bond tied in very well with Huntsman's program for international business (since I may be stationed overseas (possibly Tokyo) to do econs/business and finance-related work under the government), with the added benefit that my extracurriculars and personality didn't fit the archetype of a \"Wharton kid\" at all. Coupled with a strong liking towards Japanese culture personally and through the foreign language programme, and talking about how I explored international cultures through composition and music, and my active involvement in MUN and the humanities programme, really fit the International Studies component of Huntsman. \n\nAdvice:\nTo all applicants, you can do it! I personally was a more laid-back and reserved person in G9-10 who did almost no extracurriculars (apart from music). I had to really play catch up to even be in contention for scholarship and uni opportunities, I'm really grateful that I got great offers despite only really pushing hard in G11-12. \n\nTo Singaporean applicants, especially not from the top JCs, let me tell you that IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE! but the thing is that to surmount the odds and get scholarships and admissions to overseas unis is a lot harder given your environment and climate around you. Bear in mind that your competition is not just your fellow students in the 3 top schools, but also the international school students situated in SG. These schools have academic schedules that are more suited for overseas extracurriculars, more funding and resources for activities, guidance counsellors well-versed with the intricacies of the US system and more. It will be a very lonely road ahead of you, where you may be the only one that you know of in the journey of preparing portfolios, essays, recommendations for the US applications. This is compounded with some teachers who often give well-intentioned but sometimes misleading or untrue advice on US applications (I've experienced this first-hand!) because they themselves have had little to no experience dealing with the US application system. For instance, as deceptive as the rankings may be, it takes far more to be admitted to Princeton or Yale than NUS for any applicant, so don't just take what some say at face value. The US application system is a completely different ballgame from anything Singaporeans are normally exposed to. Do your own independent research, take the time to reflect on your own journey (even despite the helter-skelter of A-Levels preparation) and write the best essays that you can. And when you can, seize the opportunity! I got the opportunity to attend and win awards at OxfordMUN and YaleMUN not because I could fly all the way there on my own, but I took advantage during the pandemic to attend these prestigious conferences online (I would never have been able to afford the time off school or the price of just flying to these places otherwise, and my parents weren't really supportive!). I never learnt about these opportunities through the school or someone disseminating the info, but through much digging on the Internet and sourcing information myself, and my biggest regret was not doing that more when I was in school. So take the initiative to find opportunities for yourself! \n\n (For context, in SG public schools have academic years based around the calendar year, so summer programs in the US normally coincide with the middle of the school term in SG, which makes it difficult for SG students to attend these programmes. Furthermore, major internal exams are normally held right after school holidays that count towards transcripts to be sent to US colleges, which indirectly gives a tradeoff for US applicants on whether to prioritise extracurriculars and competitions during the holidays or to study for exams. For girls who don't need to serve in the military service, applying to the US is even worse as Early Action deadlines are in the middle of the final preparation towards the A-Levels, and there's only a month between the end of A-Levels and Regular Decision deadline to do all the essays.)"

My school didn't have a National Honor Society chapter. I also ended up receiving four performing arts awards and a creative writing award, but these happened way after I had received all of my decisions.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nAP Lang teacher: She was the only teacher at the time who had seen a lot of my writing and actually given it a lot of feedback. I would sometimes have extended conversations with her about my writing or about the novels that we read in class, and she tended to say that she hadn't considered a lot of the perspectives that I brought up in both my essays and our conversations. She tended to give me very good interim comments. She was definitely one of my favorite teachers I've ever had. As I applied to all of my schools under an English major, I think her LOR was very important, and I'd probably rate it an 8/10.\n\nPre-calc teacher: She also gave me very good interim comments. I was one of the few students who consistently participated in her class, was offering to help others if they didn't understand what was going on, and went to her if I had any questions, and she knew that so she was probably able to give good insight into my work ethic. I would also sometimes chat with her before or after class, and I think we had a good relationship. 8/10\n\nCounselor: He was fine but I didn't really talk to him much outside of our college related meetings. I know that the counselors at my school were supposed to converse with our teachers about us to get more insight into the different projects and things that we were doing, so he might've found out more from them that I didn't tell him. Fine counselor, but was also very blunt (told me straight to my face that I was probably going to get rejected from every school I applied to outside of my safeties) so I wasn't too fond of him, and I know that most of my peers who had him as a counselor shared the sentiment. 6/10\n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nUPenn: The lady was nice but this was my first and only interview and I honestly bombed it. Had almost no questions to ask her, I took the call in a very badly lit room at my school, I responded to her email late. The interview was over in 20 minutes. \n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nCommon App Personal Essay: I actually really liked this essay. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I wanted to write and my first couple of drafts were horrible, but then one day it finally clicked and I got it all out in about 40 minutes. I talked about how in 2021 when Asian hate crimes were on the rise, there was one story in particular that had me terrified for my life as an Asian and it was ironic because that particular story wasn't even really an Asian hate crime: it was road rage and the victim happened to be Asian. I continued to talk about how that spurred me to want to learn and immerse myself more in my culture because I didn't want to lose that connection and if I was going to be scared for my life because of one aspect of my identity, then I better know all that I can about that identity. I then talked more about the various projects that my pursuit of cultural connection spurred me to take on. I was very proud of this essay.\n\nHonestly I think a lot of my supplemental essays were really mid. I can give more details if anyone wants, but I think they were pretty average. For the why major questions, I tended to connect it to my pursuit of cultural connection and how I wanted to be able to help tell more stories. I don't think I reused any essays.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Rice ED, defer \u2014> accept + committed!! I did send a LOCI. 40k in aid\n* Emory RD, 35k in aid\n* Stony Brook EA, 11.5k scholarship\n* Binghamton EA, 13k scholarship + honors college\n* University of Houston RD, submitted early for scholarship consideration. 7k in scholarship + in-state tuition (so basically another 15k in scholarship) + honors college\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* NYU RD, denied waitlist\n* Boston College RD, denied waitlist\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Harvard RD\n* UPenn RD\n* Northwestern RD\n* Boston University RD\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI think that what probably helped get me into Rice was my sustained interests in writing and the performing arts. Rice sends a personalized banner if you get accepted along the template of \"Name, we can't wait to see how your \\[insert phrase\\] contributes to our community at Rice!\" and mine was \"passion for music and enthusiasm for mental health.\" I took almost 7 credits of arts (visual and performing combined) classes when most students take around 1-2, so I think that continued participation was beneficial. I also think that all of the writing stuff that I did helped, especially considering how I took two English core classes in my senior year. I was one of two students who did that. Of my 10 other electives that I took in senior year, two were writing related and five were arts related. I also think that my LOCI was a big deciding factor in my Rice admission. Emory asked me for a vocal, instrumental, and theatre supplemental because they saw that I did a lot of that on my application as well, but I only submitted a vocal supplement. I never did hear back from them on the outcome of that. Another thing is that we had a lot of college reps visit my school and I went to the meetings for all of the schools I applied to with the exceptions of Emory, Stony Brook, and UH because they didn't come to my school, and also BC because I had a class I couldn't miss during that time. Rice actually came to my school twice, once in May of 2023, and once in November of 2023. I attended both sessions and the lady who came both times was actually my admissions officer. I made sure to make it really clear that Rice was my first choice school both to the AO at those meetings and also in my application. As far as I'm aware, very few students from my school applied to Rice (it's not very well known in the north), and we had a student last year commit to Rice so I think that might've put more eyes on my school which in turn might've helped bolster my chances a bit.\n\nAnother thing for Rice in particular that might've helped was that I talked a lot about wanting to help my community, especially through a cultural lens, and Rice's school principles are very much built around community, so I think that they saw that my interests aligned with theirs which made me seem like a good candidate.\n\nIf anyone wants any clarification on anything or wants to see any of my essays, I'm cool with sharing them. I'm incredibly grateful for having been accepted into my top choice school and am very excited to start in the fall! Good luck to all of the rising seniors who are gonna be going through this whole process soon."

Was truly an eye opening read.\n\nAcademic Team Coach (9/10): Less well written but way more personal. Helped build intellectual curiosity. Also one of my favorite people in the world\n\nEarth Science Professor (8/10): Family friend who got me engaged in the classroom for the first time in years. The essay was not perfect but it helped showcase my actions in an academic and personal/religious/extracurricular light\n\nCity Clerk (9/10): Very personal to the point that I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing, but she is someone I loved. Saw me so far removed from an academic light that I believe it allowed me to shine from a different direction.\n\nInterviews\n\nHarvard (10/10): Amazing Guy, talked for an hour and a half. Was from the town over and had ties to where my brother went to college. Reached out to the admissions office to see if he could provide an additional recommendation. Biggest regret about not choosing Harvard will be not getting to see this file. Truly one of the best convos I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nYale (6/10): Was with a current senior. Not very memorable, but didn\u2019t go bad. Except for when I said \u201cI\u2019m excited about college because I can focus on what I want to\u201d and she said \u201cit\u2019s a liberal arts school.\u201d\n\nPrinceton (11/10): Phenomenal. No words. The most eclectic and genuine guy. He was elderly, but he was so encouraging and another amazing convo. This interview made me feel like I had a shot at an Ivy for the first time. Writing the email to let him know I chose Yale was so awful but he was so reassuring. I hope to be like this man one day.\n\nColumbia (?/10): No interview, but I was lucky enough to visit prior to apps. Columbia had no after tour meetings but I went to the AO and spoke with an officer and it was awesome. She was a resource throughout the app process and I think she may have played a big part in my acceptance (she and I talked afterward and she was very happy, I wrote a great email about how everyone at Columbia should be more like her\u2026you\u2019re the best Elizabeth Alt!!!)\n\nBrown: I think it is important to write that I knew I was not going to Brown because I visited my state flagship and like it more so I did not include a video essay.\n\nEssays \nPersonal Statement(8.5/10) I absolutely loved this piece but a lot of those who read it weren\u2019t as stunned. It was about how reading allowed me to travel across the world from my small hometown in Appalachia. I liked it and it set up so many feelers for the rest of my app. May not have been the home run, but it set it up.\n\nWhy Essays (10/10 minus Vandy and Harvard the first time): these ate lowkey. I fell in love with these schools and it showed. I connected each schools identity with what I wanted to do and it this isn\u2019t super descriptive but they were and they were deeply personal.\n\nCemetery Essay (10/10) This was my home run. Wrote about my summer job working in the cemetery. Such an impactful time and a unique experience. Wrote about how it sparked a joy in people\u2019s stories and our role as historians and links to the past. Even at Yale this is the essay people loves\n\nThat one architecture essay for Yale (10000/10): Best thing ive ever written. An extended metaphor about the power of architecture and utilized Yale architects (Maya Lin and Errol Sarinen) as key influences. Wrapped it up with a piece about the Gateway arch as a symbol of how architecture can continue to create the best future possible. I legit smile when I read this. Every. Daggum. Time.\n\nDecisions\n\n\u2022Harvard (REA) - Deferred - Accepted\n\n\u2022Yale (RD) - Accepted and Attending\n\n\u2022Princeton (RD) - Accepted\n\n\u2022Columbia (RD) - Accepted w/ Likely\n\n\u2022University of Kentucky (EA) - Accepted\n\n\u2022University of Louisville (EA) - Accepted\n\n\u2022Centre College (RD) - Accepted\n\n\u2022Vanderbilt (RD) - Waitlist\n\n\u2022Brown (RD) - Rejection :(\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI am not special. I just obsessed over the admissions process. I figured out who my Yale admissions Officer was and listened to her episode of the Yale admissions podcast probably five times. I used each part of the application to either delve into something I thought needed more explanation or introduced something new, but it always had some basis in what I had written before. It was easy to follow and I had stellar interviews. I also think I presented a very real and genuine picture of myself. I didn\u2019t embellish but I wrote about what I loved and valued. Also underrated tip, make sure the admissions office knows who you are. If I had questions, I emailed them directly as long as they weren\u2019t simple. When I didn\u2019t get interview requests for Princeton or Yale I emailed my admissions officers who gave me the \u201c it\u2019s just about availability\u201d speech but lo and behold, within a week I had interviews to both. it may seem counterintuitive, but just make sure these admissions officers see you as people, don\u2019t just be a piece of paper, let them know you are a real, intriguing, and valuable addition to their campus.\n\n"

VEX Robotics State Awards\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nAP English Lang 9/10 \u2014 we were pretty close, and he knows I won the NYT comp for an essay I wrote in his class, so that probably helped.\n\nAP Chem 6/10 \u2014 terrified of this person, got a B+ in her class and then A- the next year, but showed massive improvement so I wanted to\n\nPost AP Physics 6/10 \u2014 Absolute homie that had practiced writing a rec for me for some summer program applications I had. Not sure how much effort he would put in tho\n\nT3 Research PI 5/10 \u2014 his name held a ton of weight but judging from his email writing abilities, it was probably not that great\n\n*Got a few more recs post WLs, more research (7/10) and  debate (10/10) to submit to my favorite WLs. Maybe helped.*\n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nHarvard 8/10 \u2014 was great, we shared a lot of similarities but since it was my first I was hella nervous and probably focused on bragging too much.\n\nGeorgetown 5/10 \u2014 I was totally good but he was a lawyer and literally talked over me the entire interview.\n\nPrinceton 6/10 \u2014 Really nervous again, but got my handle on it later through it. I think my brain has erased this memory\n\nMIT 11/10 \u2014 Phenomenal interview, was in flow state the entire time.

Called me just on a regular phone call, really short, was in the grocery store and then in the car picking up his kids. Basically shit-talked me for persuing science and Northwestern instead of finance even though he himself was a neuro major that switched last second into finance...\n\nRice 8/10 \u2014 was a student that didn't know how to interview so I just gave him bite sized impressive stories about me\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App 7/10 \u2014 I liked it, just talked about how and why I got into science. Nothing overly dramatic or beautiful though\n\nSups 5/10 \u2014 LWK looking back kinda mid. Probably because I applied to so many schools and reused them, but I had a couple sick essays I think. Having said that, my UChicago essay was the best piece of writing I've ever produced and I wrote it from 11pm-4am the night before and edited 30min before the due date.\n\n**UPDATE TO ALL

Band (pep, jazz, concert, and marching)- no specific role but was designated one of the BD\u2019s 3 leaders to take over when he was absent. Was top two for both DM and Section leader candidates (my guess for not being chosen is because of my disability that requires me to take more breaks than others). I was essentially first chair clarinet but couldn\u2019t list it anywhere since we don\u2019t formally rank chairs.- 4yrs, hours are basically impossible to keep track of, but it was a lot \n2.

Because we both love biology and my school doesn\u2019t offer any upper-level biology classes, and few kids end up going into biology, we were able to geek out about it together \n\nBand teacher- if anyone knew my work ethic best it was him.Though to this day I still don\u2019t know if he actually likes me or not TT his son told me that at the very least he recognizes me as the best clarinet player but he\u2019s pretty reserved. I only submitted his LOR for colleges requiring a humanities teacher.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT interview- I felt it went very good. We were able to relate to a lot of the same stuff bc we come from the same general area. It was my first interview but the conversation flowed very smoothly- solid 8.5/10\n\nPrinceton interview- It was okay. I wasn't able to really talk about myself much because as soon as I mentioned the research I was doing she went on a small tangent about the research her daughter was doing an undergrad, so Im not sure how that corresponded to what she wrote abt me- 6/10\n\n**Essays**\n\nI wrote my main essay on my experience growing up as a plus-size kid and how that shaped me and my outlook today. I felt it was strong, but I could understand how it could be considered a cliche. \n\nMy secondary essays were focused on my love for biology; my experience in finding my identity as a lesbian and nonbinary growing up in a very heavily conservative, Christian family; and other random things like how much I love matrices.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Macalester College RD + scholarship - Attending\n* UMass Amherst RD + Scholarship\n* Virginia Tech RD + Scholarship\n* Michigan State RD + Scholarship\n* Stony Brook RD + Scholarship\n* RPI RD + Scholarship\n* ASU RD + Scholarship\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* BU \u2014> Rejected\n* Swarthmore \u2014> Rejected\n* Case Western \u2014> Rejected\n* Brandeis\n* Pitt \u2014> Withdrew\n* UW \u2014> Withdrew\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Brown RD\n* Caltech RD\n* CMU RD\n* Columbia RD\n* Cornell RD\n* Emory RD\n* Harvard RD\n* JHU RD\n* MIT RD\n* Pomona RD\n* Princeton RD\n* Stanford RD\n* UNC Chapel Hill RD\n* UPenn RD\n* Vanderbilt RD\n* WashU RD\n* Yale RD\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n\nI would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t disappointed in my results this cycle. I was hoping for at least one reach school, and only ended up getting into one target. Coming from a school that only sends 1-2 kids to a t20 every four years I thought would help give me an advantage, but ig not. In terms of test scores I was in like the top 5 in my grade, and only one other kid ended up going through this cycle, but he managed to sweep some really good schools like Northwestern, USC, Notre Dame, and Princeton. I felt like I did enough to get into a super competitive school because founding clubs and doing research is practically unheard of at my school. I may end up going through this cycle again next year as a transfer student but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get there. Ig I also thought karma would help me out a little lol, but turns out it\u2019s not like the AO\u2019s see me taking charge of my health and losing weight :/\n\n**Edit:**\nSince there are quite a few people jumping to conclusions, I wanted to put a disclaimer up here. In no way am I upset that I\u2019m going to Macalester. They gave me good aid and I love the location that it\u2019s in, I\u2019m just not sure about fit. Regardless, I plan to make use of my next few years wherever they may be. And, please, I was in no way expecting to get into all of the schools I applied to, or even half of the reaches. I simply thought I had a chance at *some* of them, and wanted to have the best chance at getting a good aid package."

I already accepted the fact that I tried my best and realized that if my happiness was tied to college applications/decisions then I would porbably be miserable during my senior year :) (my school is a UW-Madison feeder so that was my \"safety\" and every other school I applied to were reaches. Not the smartest decision but it worked out in the end!)\n\nIm just a normal kid from the Midwest and Im very happy to be attending Dartmouth next year! I would've chosen JHU but unfortunately their BME program was full :( \n\nI didnt do research at a prestigious university, I don't really have any renowned national awards, I don't have a non profit, and most importantly I didn't have any leadership positions (except maybe editor of newspaper) even though I pursued them. \n\nI think my application is proof that you should **do what makes you happy.** I continued pursuing music, I volunteered at only one place because I didnt really care about the hours, and I honestly just spoke my truths in my esssay. The Dartmouth AO sent me a card that he was especially impressed with my language skills and kindness so ig that was where I stood out lol. Anyway, **even if you don't have amazing extracurriculars, as long as you are commited to doing what makes you happy then you'll do amazing!!!** Also get good grades and stuff too \ud83d\udc80."

I put my heard & soul into the word I typed out. Probably what got me in to my schools...\n\nCommon App: Talked about working in an antique store, and how each item embodied someone's story (how the owner would tell me about the provenance of each item in depth). Related this to my older incarcerated brother's room, and how many of those items seemed like antiques to me, but I knew the stories behind each one. Ended with how I want to help my brother and others continue creating stories through my reform work.\n\nAdditional Information: Nothing except a short blurb on how ECs #1 and #2 worked and why they mattered to me.\n\nSupplementals: I re-used a few boilerplate essays. For diversity/life experiences essays, I talked about how my classmates/community saw working to destigmatize and reform the incarceration process as taboo. Yet if I didn't do it, who would? Related this to if something matters to me, I don't care what other people think. For why school essays, I just found related programs/research to what I wanted to do. For why major, I talked about combining data-based research (CS) with economic policy. **Ask me in comments if you want to know what I talked about for a specific prompt for a specific school.**\n\nAdditional Uploads: Summary of my research at #3.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* **Stanford REA** - **COMMITTED**\n* **USC** **EA** (Marshall *Business*, won Trustee Full-Tuition)\n* **UT Austin** (Business Honors) - also got full-tuition from BHP\n* **UVA EA** (Echols Scholars Honors Program)\n* **UNC EA** (Innovation Scholars Full-Ride)\n* **Harvard**\n* **Yale**\n* **Princeton**\n* **MIT**\n* **Duke**\n* **UPenn Wharton**\n* **Columbia** (Likely to College)\n* **Dartmouth**\n* **NYU Stern**\n\n*Waitlists*\n\n* Brown WL -> Accept (wrote a nice LOCI, mainly because my now-ex is going to Brown! I feel shitty about it now)\n* Georgetown WL  -> Reject (no LOCI)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UMich (Econ)\n* Cornell (Dyson, RD, so expected)\n* Northwestern (rip, but I don't care much)\n\n**Choosing**:\n\nHonestly, I'm so blessed to even have the choice between amazing schools. I thought about UT/UNC/USC because they gave me $$$, but my parents were willing to help pay for school!\n\nI was biased towards Stanford since I REAed, and although I couldn't make it to Admit Weekend, I LOVED campus (along with the weather) when I visited. I never saw myself as a super STEMy kid, so although I'm glad MIT took a chance on me, it wasn't the right school for me. Princeton\u2014spent a summer here, loved it, but honestly I want to double major, and they don't let you. Yale\u2014Bulldog Days was scary since someone literally got shot. Didn't fall in love. Dartmouth/Duke/Columbia/Brown/NYU\u2014kinda out of the picture due to my other choices and what I wanted to do in life.\n\nAt the end, I was deciding between Wharton, Harvard, and Stanford.\n\nDue to parental pressure and me not loving Quaker Days, this became Harvard vs. Stanford.\n\nI COULDN'T GO TO VISITAS or STANFORD ADMIT WEEKEND. At the end, my choice came down to the resources and opportunities I could gain access to and my undergrad. major. I was thinking about a CS/Stats major with Econ, and Stanford CS + the Hoover Institute really swayed me. I also potentially want to go to law school, and Harvard Law could be in my future :).\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nHonestly, this was all so unexpected. About this time last year I thought about EDing to Columbia or NYU since I thought I had no shot at anything without legacy. Yet I just shot my shot! In my opinion, what matters most is having a *spike* and an authentic story.\n\nWhat I would've done differently? Nothing. I loved everything I did throughout highschool and wouldn't trade it for anything. I participated in most of my ECs (except perhaps the Princeton research) because I truly wanted to. I didn't do them for college apps (again except the Princeton research). I think AOs could see this, especially since my rec letters + essays backed it all up. A lot of what I see on this sub (Science Fair + phony non-profits) doesn't always work, especially if you're creating them FOR THE GOAL, rather than the goal being created in relation to what you've done.\n\nFinal: HAVE FUN AND LIVE A BALANCED LIFE. My school was rigorous and so were my activities, but I still had fun, went to concerts, and hung out with my friends. Building a routine and managing your time are two very important skills for the rest of your life (in my humble opinion). Start early.\n\nFeel free to comment or DM me for more information. Preferably comment, because I won't check my DMs too often.\n\n**EDIT 1:** A couple of you asked about any scholarships to which I applied to. I didn't even think I had a chance at the big ones like Bryan Cameron or Coca-Cola etc... so I only applied to local ones. When I applied to my early schools, I thought I was pretty much guaranteed a spot at UT due to auto-accept, and I was fine with that. Stanford was my hyper-reach school and the state schools were targets/reaches. When I got into Stanford, I was pretty much set and applied to only reaches during the regular round!"

Talked about how interacting with people through grocery store job led to my passion for therapy/psychiatry since it solidifed my love for talking; \n7.5/10\n\nWhy major: Passionate about researching about neurodevelopmental psychology (autism) since my nephew has it, and breaking the stigma around it.\n 7/10 Why us were kinda mid.\n\nDecisions:\nAcceptances: \n\nUC Irvine\n\nUCLA (committed)\n\nUCSB\n\nUCD\n\nUCSC\n\nUCR\n\nMiddlebury\n\nColby College (presidential scholar)\n\nGrinnell (with 144k Scholarship)\n\nSyracuse (STEM Leadership Scholarship 32k a year)\n\nSCU Deans scholarship\n\nNYU\n\n\nWaitlists:\n\nBoston U (rejected)\n\nCWRU\n\nSkidmore\n\nBates\n\nUCSD\n\nColgate (rejected)\n\nHamilton WL \n\nRejections:\n\nbrown (ED)\n\nOberlin\n\nNEU\n\nWilliams (this hurt :()\n\nPomona College\n\nWash U\n\nYale\n\nColumbia\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information: sick father who had 5 surgeries (he's really old too) who caught covid and a infected heart valve, led to 2 Bs in junior year since it was quite stressful and required time.\nALSO, I heavily procrastinated, where I did the essays for each school on their deadlines (for all the ivies). UCs were the only ones i didnt do the day of so that speaks for itself. Also, coming in, i was scared to write an essay about being an immigrant and the typical story about assimilation, since a lot of ppl say it is too cliche or overused. In hindsight, it\u2019s okay to write about it. I did for NYU\u2019s supp (writing about how asian parent forced me to use forks growing up as a way of assimilation) and i think it turned out fine. But anyways, dont procrastinate, stay true to yourself, and kind of have fun in writing; you may discover new things about yourself. GoBruins!!!\n\nSorry for long post! Deep thanks for anyone who read through this."

In my Yale admissions file, I learned that he put me as one of his most outstanding students and human beings ever, with work ethic, intellect. It got a 6 from 1 reviewer and a 7 from another.\n\nThe readers noted that they thought I was a good kid who was thoughtful and other-focused.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nRice Interview- went very well and was my first one.\n\nYale interview- went very well too, he went to the same HS as me so we had a lot to talk about. He gave me a 6.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI put all I had at the time into my essays, but they were honestly very mid. I didn't really have any awareness of my identity which made my essays standard, boring, and surface level. There was no interesting vulnerability. If you want to write something good, you need to be very honest about yourself, which means you need to be very honest with yourself. It was really hard and really scary to develop this, but it means that my autobiographical writing has significantly improved since writing these essays.\n\nMy personal statement was about gardening and the climate change I've seen growing up.\n\nMy secondary essays were also suuuuper mid.

I really had no reason to be applying CS. I had experience with chem, I did some chem ECs, and got LOR from chem teacher. My story fit ChemE. My story absolutely did not fit CS.\n\nLooking at what my readers said, I got into Yale because a parent went there (my hook), and they thought I would be a good kid who would be a nice guy to have in a residential college (basically, good vibes). They noted that I wasn't rare: there are plenty of good, capable, well-intentioned applicants. My ECs were pretty standard in the Yale applicant pool, but I \"made a big impact in small pond.\" They came to this conclusion thru my LORs and my interview being very positive. I also suspect that applying ChemE is pretty unique at most colleges, and the dept is small at Yale, so that probably helped."

To improve my chances, I sought advice from classmates who had made it to T20s and Ivies. They provided valuable feedback on how I could bolster my profile and look for opportunities outside the classroom. I started preparing for transfer before graduating high school (May 2023). As a result, I spent nearly every waking hour in either academics or ECs, allowing me to achieve the following in merely 10 months. (May 2023 - March 2024)\n\n1. Research assistant at a psychology/sociology-related lab at UIUC\n2. Online research program with publication in low-stakes journal\n3. Teacher assistant at a rehab center for children with psychological disorders (over the summer)\n4. Editor for a non-profit, student-run science journal\n5. Joined every psych-related club at UIUC (separate activities)\n6. Mentored a couple of 9-11th graders and assisted them in managing academics and preparing for college\n\nCarried these over from my first-year app:\n\n1. Student Head of Drama and Performance Committee\n2. Founder/co-founder of 2 school clubs (separate activities)\n3. NPO and YouTube channel with 200k views to teach children my mother tongue (some Asian language)\n4. Mentor for the middle school robotics club\n\n**Essays**\n\nOverall (8/10): I gave my essays much more thought this time around and had a counselor look over them. I spent months and months talking to upperclassmen and professors to brainstorm a compelling reason to transfer. I tried to be as genuine as I could, resulting in no fluff and even directly addressing some challenges and failures throughout my life.\n\nBrown (9.7/10): My essays for Brown were the only essays I didn't edit. My responses to the prompts came naturally, like flowing water, and my counselor gave them the highest rating out of all my essays, even though I finished them last minute.\n\n**LORs**\n\nEnglish Professor (9.5/10): I was one of the few students who regularly participated in class and went to office hours. Said he'll write me a \"glowing rec letter.\"\n\nIntro Psych TA (7-8/10): Large class size, so he didn't really know me. However, I finished with 101% in the course by scoring perfect on everything with bonus assignments xD.\n\nResearch Prof (8/10): Was a virtual program so I tried my best to participate, gave me positive feedback on my work didn't know him personally\n\nInternship Manager (9.5-10/10) Really passionate and supportive when she heard I was studying psychology and trying to transfer. Said there aren't many kids nowadays willing to do hard and dirty work. Seemed like normal work to me, but perhaps my family was underprivileged until \\~10 years ago so my perception is biased\n\n**Results**\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Columbia\n* UPenn\n* Northwestern (This one hurt UwU. I visited and loved Evanston)\n* CMU\n* Cornell\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Vandy\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* ***Brown!!! -> committed***\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b\n* Washu\n* Emory\n* UVA\n* UMich\n\nTo all of you who may or may not have received the results you were hoping for, please don't give up hope. To quote my brown essay, \"The value of one's journey lies in its uniqueness and impact.\" Whether you choose to transfer or not, keep pushing forward, seek advice, and improve yourself. Your journey is just as valuable as your destination. Go Bruno!\ud83d\udc3b"

Princeton 2/10: was very awkward, he didn\u2019t ask me any questions and answered my questions with \u2018it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been there\u2019 or that he didn\u2019t know.

Spoke for over an hour. \n\n5. Bryn Mawr 8/10: was also very informative and she as interested in my story but we never went in depth. Spoke for an hour. \n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nPersonal statement: wrote about change and moving to a new country and school after setting up a foundation, drew parallels to parent who immigrated and tied it to my desire to create opportunities for those who don\u2019t have the same resources, wrote about having to find my way on my own and self study for SAT, figure out APs, American education system, etc. \n\nSupplements: mostly discussed life abroad and experiences with a variety of different people, also highlighted values I learnt from communities with lesser resources.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n1.

Princeton - RD\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*(anything of relevance)*\nI did not think I\u2019d be this lucky and I\u2019m so grateful for the offers I got. Coming from an international system, and a family who stressed it was only worth studying in the US if it was a good college (before we moved) I was pretty set on applying only to these 20 schools without considering a safety. Definitely contemplated adding more schools after I submitted all these apps but decided to take my chances after hearing back for interviews.  Speaking of, most of the schools except Bryn Mawr and Dartmouth did not have a positive result even after interviewing so just goes to show how little they help. Anyway, good luck to the next cohort! And remember, LACs are your best friends. "

NW, he asked me a bunch of stuff about high school (he was deciding which one to send his daughter to) and expressed admiration about some of the stuff I did/my \"professionalism\"(?) overall.

Spoiler alert I was rejected from both lol.\n\nEverything else was pretty average.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App was about empathy (I trauma dumped 4 times) & how it got me into game dev. Why us/major was about my research (it's the perfect intersection between CS & humanity; I always wrote that I loved both, even if I was applying CS), community about game development/my game jams, leadership about journalism (that one time our advisor blocked the publishing of an issue bc it depicted tampons lmao).\n\nAdded a few quirky things to some of my applications (mainly the private schools), like electing my cat for president or an attempt at an emoji or some random stuff like that.\n\nI spent my summer writing CA & UCs, then refined them later.

Math Teacher (7/10) - Had a good relationship with her and did well in her class, but didn\u2019t always take her class super seriously, which could have impacted the letter.\n\n2. English Teacher (8/10) - Had a good relationship with her, but English was never my strong suit. I heavily participated in class, so I think that may have benefited my letter.\n\n3. Counselor (5/10) - Didn\u2019t have a close relationship with her since my school is fairly large, but I am sure it was a positive letter, just not super personalized.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n1. Princeton (8/10) - The interviewer was super nice and very informed on Data / Computer Science. The conversation carried well the entire time. I was told the interview would last about a half hour, but it went for around 90 minutes.\n\n2. Dartmouth (5/10) - Nothing necessarily went wrong. I just feel I didn\u2019t click with the interviewer and it definitely felt like an interview and not at all like a conversation. The questions were pretty static and the interviewer didn\u2019t really seem to have any passion or desire to be talking to me in the first place. \n\n3. Cornell (N/A) - It was just a conversation where I got to ask questions about Cornell over the phone. It was nothing special, and if anything made me like Cornell less than when I applied.\n\u200b\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement: Wrote about how I was interested in filmmaking and how it transformed my life. I didn\u2019t necessarily have any traumatic or incredibly unique experiences in life, so this was my best attempt at coming up with something somewhat interesting.\n\nUC PIQs:\n\n1. Wrote about my experience volunteering for a youth sports league and how the kids I was coaching really impacted my outlook on life.\n\n2. Wrote about my experience in the IB Diploma Program - how it shaped my personality and the academic struggles that came along with it.\n\n3. Wrote about my love for math and statistics - nothing super unique, but really just wanted to express my passion for the subject.\n\n4. Wrote about my love for filmmaking and how it shaped my life (very similar to my personal statement, just toned down for UC word requirement).\n\u200b\nI previously mentioned my skills in English were subpar, but I feel like I write at a fairly high level. My textual analysis is just a little bit weaker than others. I think that my essays really carried my applications.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* University of Arizona (RD)\n* Ohio State University (EA)\n* Florida State University (RD)\n* University of California Santa Cruz (RD)\n* Louisiana State University (RD)\n* University of California Santa Barbara (RD)\n* California State University Long Beach (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* University of Washington (RD / Didn\u2019t Join)\n* Carnegie Mellon University (RD / Didn\u2019t Join)\n* San Diego State University (RD / Didn\u2019t Join)\n* University of California Davis (RD / Didn\u2019t Join)\n* University of California Los Angeles (RD / Joined / Accepted / Committed)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Stanford (REA)\n* Harvard (RD)\n* Princeton (RD)\n* Brown (RD)\n* Columbia (RD)\n* Dartmouth (RD)\n* Cornell (RD)\n* Yale (RD)\n* University of Pennsylvania (RD)\n* Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (RD)\n* Duke (RD)\n* Georgia Tech (EA II)\n* University of California San Diego (RD)\n* University of California Irvine (RD)\n* University of California Berkeley (RD)\n\nMy overall thoughts:\nI personally did not expect to get into any of the ivies or top schools, but I wanted to shoot my shot with them anyways. I also think the distribution of my decisions is pretty ironic considering that I ended up at UCLA, but was rejected from schools that are definitely known to be easier to get into. My ECs were not strong and a lot of my application relied on my high academics / GPA, so I was extremely surprised to not get into SDSU or Cal Poly SLO - two schools that only consider academics. When the decisions first started rolling out I was very disappointed because I really wanted to go to UCLA, but was being rejected / waitlisted from much \u201ceasier\u201d schools. In the end, it all worked out! I think my results can really attest to the randomness of the whole process and serve as a reminder as to never give up because the colleges are all truly independent of one another and being rejected from one does not indicate anything about another."

Talked about how the powerlifting community was very close-knit and I basically knew everyone bc I'm very social, then on the way out I saw someone I knew from powerlifting and dapped them up. I told my interviewer about the interaction in my thank you note, in case he didn't hear it.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement was about my powerlifting journey, which started with helping me get over health issues to me helping others improve their quality of life.

He was very familiar with my accomplishments in high school and could speak well to the things that really didn't have a place to put it on my application (like what I was doing to self-study math and in the independent study for chemistry). He also wrote a rec letter for a scholarship that I applied to the previous year, so he already had a foundation. **9/10**\n\n*Debate / AP English Language Teacher*\n\nThis teacher was probably one of the few teachers in the humanities that I got to form a genuine connection with. I got to know her on a more personal basis my sophomore year in debate class as it had fewer students and a lot of seniors, so it was very laid-back (in fact I wrote my essay about this class lol). The following year, I had her for AP Lang, so in total I had her for a year and a half before she wrote my rec letter. I trust that she wrote a good letter, but I never got to see it. **?/10**\n\n*AP Calculus BC Teacher*\n\nThis guy loved me. I came into his class loving math so he saw my enthusiasm and put a lot of resources in front of me and I sort of just consumed them. He encouraged me to take DE courses on my own (as a sort of \"7th hour\" where our school only does 6) and, even though it didn't work out, he went out of his way to Email old colleagues in several districts so I could take the AMC 12 exam. His letter was very similar to my chemistry teacher's letter, but was more focused on my work in math. He's a UMich alum, so I made sure to use his letter for them. **7/10**\n\n*French II Teacher*\n\nI took a risk on this one. My French II teacher, whom I had for only a semester freshman year, was the same teacher who taught me French in elementary school all those years ago. I had the opportunity to talk with her a number of times since I took her class and she happened to witness a few \"good deeds\" that I had done around the school (a few I had no clue she was there). This letter sort of \"humanized\" me and differentiated me from the others who had good stats and good grades. More than anything, it was a testament to my character. In hindsight I made a major blunder only using her letter for one school (RIT). I think that had I included her letter instead of my AP Lang teacher's, I would've had a better shot at getting into some of the top schools. **10/10**\n\n**Interviews**\n\n*Note: Neither of my interviews had any bearing on admissions. They were merely informative.*\n\nPrinceton - A little bit awkward. The gentleman I spoke to majored in history, which is like the polar opposite of chemical engineering and chemistry. It made it hard to connect on a deeper level, but we were able to connect on the basis of Model UN and the value of involvement in student groups, especially as a leader. **4/10**\n\nCornell - This one went a lot smoother. The man I spoke to was a mechanical engineering major and worked at a facility less than 10 minutes from my home, so we were not only able to connect on the basis of our interests, but I had elite-level small talk based on local things going on. Since he had completed his bachelor's and master's at Cornell, I was able to ask about both programs since I'm considering getting a master's. This was definitely the *ideal* interview from an admissions standpoint had it been counted towards the admissions process. **10/10**\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy essay was on the topic of the flow of knowledge, lessons, and mentorship within a high school environment. I reflected on my experience coming out of COVID. The rest of my school had been in-person for a semester while I had been online for the first semester. Because of this, I was socially \"behind\" and had to form a lot of new connections. Although I had formed plenty of connections by the beginning of my sophomore year, I continued to struggle to create a sense of identity in the social context of high school, but a senior and his friends in my debate class kind of \"took me in\" and mentored me as far as what I should do to be successful in my classes and how to maintain a balance.\n\nI didn't know until about a week later, but that student was that class's valedictorian and he had essentially given me all of his advice about what he thinks he did right and all of his regrets in high school, how he would have changed his classes, etc. Beyond academics, though, he taught me how to be a leader. Beyond being val, he was class VP, President of NHS, varsity captain for two sports, among other things. I began to put his words into actions and, along the way, made some modifications. From his advice, over the course of the next two years, I would experience leadership firsthand and would pass that on to my peers in the class of 2026 and 2027.\n\nUltimately, the theme of my essay was about how interaction with your peers and creating communities within a school creates opportunities for well-wishing seniors to pass on their experiences to underclassmen and how it generates a self-sustaining culture of kindness and caring. Finally, I tied this into how I would contribute to a college campus and how my involvement in student groups could create these \"sub-communities\" and, within those, maintain a similar culture of kindness.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* University of Michigan (EA) - **Committed**\n* Cornell University (RD)\n   * My only Ivy League acceptance and the hardest acceptance among my applications\n* Georgia Institute of Technology (EA)\n   * Hardest EA acceptance\n* Michigan Technological University (RD)\n* Purdue University (EA)\n* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (EA) **Deferred -> Accepted RD**\n   * My only EA deferral\n* Rochester Institute of Technology (RD)\n* Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (EA)\n* University of Toledo (Rolling Admission) (Accepted to Honors College)\n* University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (EA)\n* Western Michigan University (EA)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Rice University (RD) **Declined Waitlist Offer**\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Princeton University (RD)\n* Stanford University (RD)\n* The University of Texas at Austin (RD)\n   * This one surprised me and my school's counselors. Even though I saw their acceptance rate took a literal nosedive this year, I figured it should have still been well within reach. I spent a good amount of time refining my essays to the point that I thought they couldn't get any better for their topic and I thought my stats were right up there with everyone else, but I wonder what I could have done better to get in. If you have any thoughts, please tell me.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*Aside from UT Austin's rejection and RPI's deferral, I found that my results were incredibly consistent, something that I feel is rarely seen among ivy league and T20 applicants. I wonder if the rejection from UT Austin may come from the fact that out-of-state applicants are far more competitive than in-state applicants, so it is harder to get in off the bat by virtue of being out-of-state for a public school and then on top of that it's just a more qualified pool of applicants. RPI's deferral I honestly have no explanation for. This one just confused me.*"

I didn't have the closest connection to this teacher, but I was confident that I could ask him for a letter of rec.\n\nMath Teacher (5/10): Had in freshman and sophomore year for precalc and calc ab, but not for junior year. Wasn't really close to him or talked to him that much, I just didn't have any other teachers that I could ask.\n\nCounselor (3/10): Didn't talk to her much, which is not ideal. If you're applying, make an effort to know your school counselor better.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nInterviewed for UPenn, Northwestern, and one more school I forgot. They went alright; not stellar, but definitely not terrible.\n\nAuditioned for music schools (classical piano performance), which I think is pretty important. From most recent to least recent:\n\nCurtis Institute: Travelled alone to Philly for 4 days; hotels let me check in because I told them I was auditioning. Never thought I'd pass the prescreen round, since this school is more selective than Harvard. Was rejected after the first live audition round: Curtis does two live auditions, unlike most schools where you only do one. It was also my worst audition, since I was incredibly nervous and flubbed my etude.\n\nJuilliard School: Travelled alone, stayed at YMCA. Audition went alright, didn't play too musically; the interview was terrible. The interview was right after a theory test that was right after the audition, and the interviewer (who was a composition faculty at Juilliard) asked me when Beethoven was born, died, and when he wrote the piece I played. Also told me to improvise on the piano, which I couldn't.\n\nNorthwestern Bienen: Travelled with dad. Audition was decent; made audible mistakes, but I think I was musical enough to not have them be too noticeable. The facilities are incredible, best facilities I've ever seen at a music school.\n\nOberlin Conservatory: Travelled alone, travel fund. Was decent for my first audition.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI had a counselor for my common app, and a different one for my other school-specific essays. I invested a lot of time into my essays, but having a counselor definitely helped a lot. I ended up repurposing a lot of essays across art/music schools because they asked similar questions.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Brown-RISD Dual Degree Program (RD, committed)\n* Brown University (RD)\n* Cornell Architecture (RD)\n* USC Architecture (RD)\n* Northwestern Music (RD)\n* UMich Music (RD, sent in videos instead of live audition)\n* The New School, Parsons Illustration (RD)\n* RISD (RD, came out b4 dual degree decision)\n* Cal State Fullerton Art (RD)\n* Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Architecture (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Juilliard (rejected)\n* Carnegie Mellon Design (didn't join the waitlist)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Columbia Architecture (RD)\n* Columbia-Juilliard Program (RD)\n* UPenn Design (RD)\n* Curtis Institute Music (RD, after first live audition)\n* New England Conservatory of Music (RD, prescreen round)\n* Northeastern Design (EA)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI didn't want to apply to any schools ED because at the time I was still seriously considering going to a full on music conservatory program, where you have to go through the whole video prescreen and live audition process. I applied to Northeastern EA on a whim because I saw they didn't have essay requirements, but I did submit a portfolio. I applied for 4 different majors: architecture, design, illustration, and music (classical piano performance). My resume and common app was very music heavy because it was what I focused on a lot in high school; I submitted music supplements where I could, such as to Cornell and Brown even though I wasn't applying as a music major.\n\nInsight for musicians: music is incredibly stressful. I was stressed recording my prescreen, stressed while waiting for results, and stressed while auditioning. For me, in hindsight, it wasn't really worth all the money and effort to fly across the US to audition for a school you might get rejected from. People who aren't applying to music, and I don't mean this in a rude way, have it much easier because they don't need to visit the college during their application process. Curtis was a dream school, but it didn't work out."

        "post": "I always browsed through this subreddit as a Junior last year, so it's weird how I can finally post my results as a high school graduate now. Before Junior year, I didn't take high school as seriously as I should have,  flying through easy classes with good grades and that was it. I constantly felt inferior when I heard what my peers were doing (and I still do sometimes!), especially for my demographic. I began to take harder classes and research potential careers-- BUT still, I told myself that I wasn't going to shape myself into a student that I'm not. \n\nI think my stats are pretty average, which might give you some hope (unless you're aiming for Ivys then you should take this post with a grain of salt), so here it is!\n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: Female \n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian/Chinese\n* Residence: South \n* Income Bracket: Around 30,000\n* Hooks: First-Gen, Rural/Small Town\n\n**Intended Major:** Mechanical Engineering\n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA/Rank: 4.0 UW, Top 10%\n* Number of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc: 9 APs + some honors but I forgot how many\n* Senior Year Course Load: 5 APs\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\nSAT/ACT: 1370, only submitted to public schools; *I\u2019m not the best test taker so I went test-optional for everything*\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n1.

QuestBridge College Prep Scholars + Finalist\n2. State Level Summer Program\n3. Small Engineering Program\n4. Some CollegeBoard awards\n\n**Essays/LORs/Interviews:**\n\nMy essays were the strongest part of my applications, but I won't reveal much since it is very personal to me. I had some friends and teachers look over it so I was confident with it. LORs were from my foreign language teacher and CS teacher. \n\nNot sure if this counts as an interview but I encountered my QB AO at a college fair during application season!\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n1. >!WashU - Matched + Committed!<\n2. Auburn University EA\n3. University of Alabama EA\n4. University of Georgia EA\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nMy parents are Chinese immigrants so the only schools they knew were our state schools and Ivy Leagues. Initially, I felt a lot of pressure to specifically aim for those schools. However, when I told them I got matched to my school, they did a lot of research to learn more about >!WashU!<, and they were extremely proud of me. They loved the school when we visited, and I'm sure the full ride was a huge factor too ;)\n\nI mainly depended on the match for a guaranteed full scholarship because I didn't want my parents to pay a single cent, and it luckily worked out in the end! I wanted to go to a school where I can not only grow academically, but also personally and independently, away from the conveniences of my home, and I can\u2019t wait for what's to come next year :)\n\n  \nIf you know me irl no you don't"

A few class awards\n6. I later sent the schools an update that I was selected as a candidate for U.S. Presidential Scholars\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCounselor - 10/10, I had a really special bond with my college counselor, she talked about me but she also did very well in patching up the holes in my application (mainly, my poor performance in Spanish and my poor 9th grade performance, which were both due to COVID as well as me moving)\n\nMath teacher - 9/10, she had me all 4 years of high school for Geometry, Alg II, Financial Topics and Stats, she saw me improve MASSIVELY over all four years and I am very talkative in class and like to help others. This one was prob a big W.\n\nHistory Teacher - 10/10, she had me for PR History, Human Geo, and Comp Gov, but she was also the advisor for my volunteering program and the community outreach program so she saw my passion for geography in class as well as seeing me in leadership and community roles outside of class. \n\n**Interviews**\n\nYale: 6/10\n\nI don't remember too much ab this cause it was back in december but it wasn't really anything special. It was my first interview so I was nervous but I answered her questions well and we talked about what we liked about Yale and whatnot, but nothing stood out too much.\n\nGeorgetown: 9/10\n\nI was confident for this one, me and the interviewer had a lot of shared things we could talk about (we both lived in brazil for a while). He was American, so he was different from the other interviewers but it still went great. I talked a lot about my passion for Georgetown and how i loved the SFS and the STIA program I applied to (he also went to the SFS so we talked a lot about that).\n\nMIT: 9/10\n\nI think this one went really well, the interviewer was very shy as was I but we got along really well and we talked about my experiences with science (He was a chemistry researcher at the university) and I explained to him the STS major that I wanted to major in at MIT, as well as what I liked about MIT, and he talked about his experience there as well. After the interview itself he showed me around his research lab and it was amazing. The whole interview took around 2-3 hrs.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement: I had a funny movie reference hook, and I talked about my passion for music and how listening to music helped me make friends when I was new to this school,helped me make my connections deeper with friends and family, and helped me stay connected to Brazil after I moved away\n\nCommunity Disruption: I wrote about how I lived in Brazil my entire school life and during covid I moved to Puerto Rico, and I talked about how I had a difficult time integrating to new school/school system and making friends and keeping up with academics\n\nSupplements - In the \"why your major\" supplement I talked aboiut my passion for geography and how I wanted to combine Intl relations with science and how you can't have politics without science type beat. My extracurricular supplements were about my volunteering program. I also talked about in a lot of essays about moving to Brazil at a young age, and now moving back to Puerto Rico. \n\n**Legacy:** \n\nDad Yale Undergrad, Stanford MBA\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Yale (REA, Deferred) - Committed\n* Stanford (RD)\n* Northwestern (RD)\n* University of Michigan (EA)\n* Middlebury (RD)\n* Northeastern (RD)\n* George Washington Univ. (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Boston College (RD)\n* Georgetown (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT (RD)\n* Columbia (RD)\n* Dartmouth (RD)\n\n*Withdrew:*\n\nClaremont McKenna, University of Rochester\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nMost of my high school career, I don't think I gave myself enough credit for how well I was doing - My entire GPA was weighed down by my poor 9th grade COVID performance - my GPA progression went something like this: 9th - 3.6, 10th - 4.45, 11th - 4.5, 12th - 4.78 with a total 4.3, which is not terrible in my high school but I don't think it was representative of my academic skill. \n\nDid I get in because of legacy? We'll never know. Stanford only takes around 1 student from PR each year, and I was the only one on the island and the first from my school in 6 years to get in. Yale is a bit more common, but I'm not so sure since I got deferred. Overall however, I'm feeling good about my results because I did get into other top schools like Northwestern and UMich and I feel like I worked a lot to deserve those. Maybe colleges saw my upward trend and high SAT score and saw that to compensate for my low GPA. Anyways, if anyone has any questions or wants to see essays, Hmu!"

They showed us the recommendations ahead of time.\n\n9/10 Music teacher. Taught him 3 years.  Wrote about how accomplished my son was as a cellist. He also wrote about how my son overcame the shock of not being able to play at the same level after a car crash.\n\n9/10 Spanish teacher. Taught him two years. Wrote about how he went from 0 to fluent in a year.\n\n9/10 Jewish Studies teacher. Taught him at a summer program at Brandeis University that my son went to make sure he could handle regular courses with his brain injury. He isn't super religious but the teacher wrote an incredible recommendation.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMy son contacted the cello teacher at every school he applied to. (At Harvard and Case Western he contacted the affiliated music schools.) He played for teacher and did a short lesson to make sure they would like working together. In each lesson the teacher asked why he wasn't going to music school and he explained the head injury.\n\n**Essays**\n\nFirst essay: Wrote about the car crash where he lost his ability to hear the highest notes and he had to figure out what else to do with his life. He learned Spanish without being able to read or write while he was recovering from the head injury, and then did research on how kids with disabilities can learn a second language the way he did.\n\nSecond essay: Wrote about how learning Spanish helped him connect with his cultural roots and his experience being a translator for recent immigrants.\n\nExtra essay: Explained why he graduated late. He spent two years in recovery and then decided to do junior year a second time so he could prepare for a regular college instead of a conservatory.\n\n**Decisions** \n\n*Accepted*\n\n* Duke (going there!) (95% scholarship)\n* Brandeis (95% scholarship)\n* Northeastern (95% scholarship)\n* Miami of Ohio (95% scholarship)\n\n*Waitlist:*\n\n* NYU (withdrew)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Harvard\n* Cornell\n* Case Western\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI learned a few things that might help other parents/kids going through the process:\n\n1. Schools don't care if you graduate high school late as long as there's an explanation.\n2. The recommendations can go a long way making up for grades/scores as long as the recommender is a university professor and can compare the applicant to college students they've taught.\n3. It's hard to understand how your story plays out on the application because you're so close to the story. We probably should have hired a college consultant to help us understand how admissions officers would read the application. At the time it seemed so expensive, but in hindsight it was too risky that we didn't hire someone.\n4. Arguing about aid works. Miami of Ohio accepted him before the other schools but offered no aid. After pushing, we received 95% aid. A teacher at the university coached me on how to argue. This is probably another reason why we should have hired a college application counselor to help us; it's hard to know what you don't know, even after reading this subreddit obsessively."

Really enjoyed talking with her.\n\n**Essays**\n\nEssays were meh except one supplemental for Yale. My main was maybe a 7/10. I've lived a really boring life so I didn't have a lot to talk about.

As I said above, I do plan on reading my admissions file and will post later. I also plan on doing an AMA when after I read my files.\n\nMy advice is to start early. Identify who your LOR's will be and ask them by the end of April. Start drafting an outline for your common app essay. Also enjoy what you do. I did what I loved and it showed with my EC's. Also don't take 6 AP's senior year. It made a stressful year even more stressful. Lmk if you have any questions.\n\n  \nEdit: formatting, also removed confusing filler word"

Coxswain of HS Crew, participated in freshman and sophomore year before ending it due to COVID (1st and 2nd cycle)\n3. Volunteer work at a cultural summer camp including leadership roles in engagement, ranked up from junior to senior position (1st and 2nd cycle)\n4.

AP Scholar with distinction\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nTeacher: (7/10): So after browsing through this subreddit, it seems like people often overinflate their rec letter ratings. I'd have to say though, my teacher recs must have been pretty good since they won me that NASA scholarship (and the team specifically said that it was the rec letters)!\n\nCounselor: (3/10) I'm just giving it a conservative rating... anyway, this is one thing that was really out of my control, and it's honestly kind of a sad story. My school assigns counselors by name, and I had a counselor that I was particularly close with and would meet with frequently. It was really sad to see her go in my junior year, and so one of the other counselors (still a nice guy) was forced to substitute as ours instead. Needless to say, I didn't have much time to connect with him as much as his other students, and I'm not sure if his letter could have stood out too much from other students that he knew much more.\n\nInterviews\n\nHarvard (1st cycle): (6/10) So, as a first interview, I thought it went quite well. We laughed together and shared our stories of how we grew up and connected through that. It started slightly awkward (video isn't the ideal form of communication) but otherwise went well. Lasted substantially longer than the scheduled time.\n\nUPenn (1st cycle): (5/10) Pretty standard interview. The interviewer was very enthusiastic, but the conversation was a bit more formal and less exciting. Got to know a lot about the school though, so that was good. 45 minutes, not bad.\n\nDartmouth (2nd cycle) (8/10): Probably my best interview. He shared a lot in common with me and we were able to talk a lot about our cultural similarities and how Dartmouth would be a great fit. It lasted almost 2 hours and we had a great time!\n\nA bit surprised by the lack of interviews, but maybe this is normal.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI feel like while I thought at the time my essays were good, in hindsight, they probably weren't. I'm inclined to think that my writing ability is not that great, but I tried and gave it a lot of time. For the personal essay, I first wrote about how Japanese calligraphy had given me a new way to see the world, but looking back, I may have looked a bit introverted from the way it was written. For the second cycle, I talked about sports, which looking back I felt was even more of a cliche. I only chose to write about it because at the time it was suggested to me and I thought it could work. I will say, however, that my supplemental essays were probably much better and very school - specific.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Decisions** (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nFIRST CYCLE: EXTREMELY TOP - HEAVY, DON'T DO THIS UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED FOR REJECTION!\n\nAcceptances:\n\nUMD (EA) (originally committed but was denied to defer acceptance to next year)\n\nWaitlists (honestly surprised that I didn't get more waitlists):\n\nUChicago (RD) (later rejected)\n\nRejections:\n\nBerkeley\n\nCaltech (RD)\n\nColumbia (RD)\n\nHarvard (RD)\n\nJohns Hopkins (RD)\n\nMIT (RD)\n\nPrinceton (RD)\n\nStanford (RD)\n\nUCLA\n\nUMich (EA, defer ---> reject)\n\nUPenn (RD)\n\nYale (RD)\n\nSECOND CYCLE: Still top - heavy but more balanced with a mix of safeties, targets, and reaches\n\nAcceptances:\n\nBaylor (RD, 23k scholarship), rejected BS/MD\n\nCWRU (RD, 31.5k scholarship) (committed, but may just go to CC tbh), rejected BS/MD\n\nPurdue FYE (RD)\n\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RD, 36k scholarship), rejected BS/MD\n\nSUNY Stony Brook (RD, 28k scholarship), rejected BS/MD\n\nUniversity College London (school in the UK)\n\nWayne State (RD, 6.5k scholarship), rejected BS/MD\n\nWaitlists (honestly surprised that I didn't get more waitlists):\n\nGWU (RD) (declined waitlist offer), rejected BS/MD\n\nUChicago (RD) (later rejected \ud83d\udc94)\n\nRejections:\n\nBrown (RD), rejected BS/MD\n\nCambridge (in the UK)\n\nCornell (RD)\n\nDartmouth (RD)\n\nDuke (RD)\n\nHarvard (RD)\n\nHarvey Mudd (RD)\n\nJohns Hopkins (RD)\n\nNorthwestern (RD)\n\nUMich (RD)\n\nUPenn (RD)\n\nVanderbilt (RD)\n\nAlso got straight up ghosted by UMD \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Additional info/Final thoughts** (IMPORTANT):\n\nExtra things that I thought would help me stand out:\n\nI took AP Calc BC in 8th grade and scored a 5 on the AP test (lol this might already give me away), and my middle and high school had to make a special curriculum/arrangement for me (and potential future students who were advanced in their classes).\n\nAlso, I was the only person to have dual enrolled in math, after literally running out of math courses to take at my already competitive high school. Diff EQ was no joke, but it was a really useful class and I did very well.\n\nTook every double period and AP science course at least one year ahead of my peers.\n\nI also talked extensively about traveling to Asia in my gap year, and how I utilized my language skills to interact with people. I talked about how it has opened me to new perspectives and how interacting with communities broadened my outlook.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: after two years of straight rejections from top schools, I have to say I've been extremely invested in this process, if not anything more than for the sake of my younger brother, who is gonna need as much advice from me as possible given the fierce competition.\n\nSo yeah in the end college admissions cooked me to a crisp. Besides my unremarkable personal statement and (possibly) mediocre counselor rec, I really can't understand what went wrong. Maybe this year was just too competitive with test - optional policies, and I'm pretty sure there are kids with <1400 SATs from my school who went TO and got into top schools. Also, I will say that evidently, top schools couldn't care less about your course rigor, at least beyond a certain amount. They don't care that you took AP Physics C in elementary school or can speak 10 languages. I went in with the mindset of \"all it takes is one\", though I guess even that was too much to ask for :/ Anyway, my #1 piece of advice?\n\nAPPLY EARLY. Seriously, I think this was my biggest downfall. I can't believe I didn't learn from my first application cycle, but too late to change that now. THIS APPLIES ESPECIALLY IF YOUR SCHOOL REGULARLY SENDS STUDENTS TO TOP SCHOOLS. It doesn't matter if you have new stuff that you want to show by the regular decision deadline. You can always update stuff in your portal later. If you apply RD, universities may already have selected their share of students from your school. Honestly given how UChicago heavily pads their yield, I might have been accepted had I applied ED there. Or maybe JHU. I don't even know :/\n\nI will say though, I think Purdue was an interesting outlier. Even though their engineering program is quite competitive (especially OOS), they specifically reached out to me and asked for my CC dual enrollment grade which no other university did. I think that compelled them to offer me admission, and turning them down was a really hard decision that I still don't even know was the right move. I am extremely grateful for that though.\n\nStill, I'm honestly feeling quite lost considering all my work, and I\u2019m lowkey considering going to a CC given how burnt out I am. What makes it even worse is that it's looked down upon by every person in my school community and even by my parents and relatives. At least I'll save money, right?\n\nAlso remember if you're reading this and you didn't get into a top college, DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED. This sub has an INSANE amount of response bias, and posts with titles like \"clutching an ivy\" or \"scored a miracle\" just aren't representative and you shouldn't compare yourself to them. Not everyone gets a satisfactory outcome and you aren't alone. For the sake of your happiness, if you're applying to top universities, just expect to get rejected from all of them. Don't bank on getting into one of them even if you think you are talented or extraordinary in some regard. Chances are that they just don't care. And unless you think you can do something remarkable in a gap year, don't take one just to reapply. It's just not worth it.\n\nAnyway, vent over. It doesn't really matter anyway, I'll crush those transfer apps \ud83d\ude0c"

I had decently good grades (save for freshman year) but almost nothing else. Happy with where I committed though, because I don't really care about prestige that much anymore and just want to develop as a person, plus no undergrad debt is nice. USF also has a BSMD program (not guaranteed, but benchmarks basically give you acceptance into their med school) so I'm also declaring my intent for that, but honestly would be fine also going into research."

I didn't even read them again after submitting because I'd die of embarrassment from stuff I missed.\n\nResults:\n\nUC Santa Cruz -> Waitlisted -> Accepted\n\nUC Riverside -> Accepted\n\nUC Merced -> Accepted\n\nUC Berkeley -> Reject\n\nUCLA -> Reject\n\nUC Davis -> Waitlist -> Accepted\n\nUC Santa Barbara -> Waitlist -> Accepted -> Committed\n\nUC Irvine -> Reject\n\nUC San Diego -> Waitlist (probably would commit if I got in)\n\nUC doesn't consider your freshman year courses in GPA calculations, which is why I applied to only UCs, although I'm fairly certain they still look at them for admissions purposes especially at the top schools.\n\nIn freshman year, during COVID, I pretty much did not show up to any classes and got 2 Ds first semester. I didn't get a single A the whole year and had a 2.1 GPA by the end. After going back to in person, I started getting almost all As, but it's pretty hard to recover your GPA from that. To be honest, school comes ridiculously easy for me, and I probably spent \\~2 hours total studying for the SAT and all my AP exams combined. I am just exceptionally lazy and did not put in much effort, partly because I was already demotivated from freshman year. I wrote my entire UC application in the span of 2 nights because I didn't think I'd get into a single school lmao.\n\nSince I wasn't really shooting for any college, I didn't really do anything in HS with the goal of \"getting into college\". I just did ECs that were fun and/or I was passionate about. Most of my free time is spent either doing math or coding instead of going outside so I didn't have a lot of tangible ECs that I could really put on the application.\n\nMy original plan was just to head to community college and lock in, but I'm pretty happy with UCSB and committed for applied math. I may try to apply to CCS Mathematics after a year, but we'll see. I am still on the UCSD waitlist, and I'd most likely go if I was admitted for Math/CS, which is my ideal major. I really love both subjects and spend most of my free time either studying math or coding so I'm pretty excited for a fresh start in college.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share to show that you can still make it to a decent school even with an abysmal GPA like mine! With my stats you'd think I'm an athletic recruit! (jk no hate). Just need a strong upwards trend of improvement, and ideally some test scores to offset it."

He was kinda awkward so I avoided talking to him lol, but his LOR was actually really good. He said that he wanted his daughter to grow up to be like me!\n* AP US History Teacher (8/10): junior year teacher; I always had an A in his class but never talked either.

I felt like my essay was pretty good, but I thought it might be controversial depending on the reader so I was a little nervous. I'm not that good of a writer, but I think the content made up for it. I basically talked about my experience growing up mixed race and how I won't let race define me. I thought it might be problematic because I said a black girl was being racist to me by mentioning how a black girl once told me I only got straight A's because I was \"white\" and that I realized that some people use race as an excuse for their failures. I said that I thought it was sad she was raised to think that way and ended by saying I wouldn't let my race dictate what I should like or how I should behave and that I would decide for myself rather than following others.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)!!!

I feel so lucky and fortunate to be in the situation I am. I know I had my GPA and low income going for me, but I got so much more than I ever expected and I still can't believe this is actually happening!! QuestBridge didn't work out, but I still ended up getting what I was looking for: a way to go to college without taking out loans.\n\nSo to explain me being able to \"go to Virginia Tech for Free,\" I have multiple sources that are paying for my first year; I didn't just get a full ride from VT (although it basically is when combined with everything else). I got about $15,500 in govt. grants, the scholarship from VT to cover the rest of tuition and room and board which is about $17,000 this year, and $12,000 in outside scholarships. And that's way over the COA, so I don't have to worry about paying anything!! Now I can follow my dreams of being an animator at my dream school without worrying about how to pay for it!!!"

My class particularly is extremely competitive since my peers have landed internships, summer programs, found non profits, play sports or music internationally etcetc. I know these people most likely started early in their ecs but unfortunately no one guided me and I didn\u2019t even know about college admissions things up until the beginning of my sophomore year. By then, I tried creating a VSA (Vietnamese Student Association) club within my school campus but we didn\u2019t really do much since there wasn\u2019t a wide range of Vietnamese people within our school and an even lesser percentages wanted to join (since everyone was focused on starting their non profits and doing their own initiative). It didn\u2019t really help that the officers I had weren\u2019t very enthusiastic about the club and barely contributed. I kept comparing my club to another new club where in the first year they already raised over 1k and packaged over 100 kits to donate. I am very happy for them but at the same time puzzled and envy them. How did we start off at the same time but they were more successful than my club? I wanted to get new officers the upcoming year but it doesn\u2019t look so promising since I had released an application out but no as much people showed interested and one of my previous officers who actually contributed somewhat to the club, is opting out due to their busy schedule. I am unsure if what to do and I don\u2019t have as many ecs either. I have a lot of ideas to start non profits and clubs but I don\u2019t know what it takes to make them successful and find people who are enthusiastic and are willing to support me and make it grow. I also want to have more ec and deepen my involvement with them. I am willing to put in the dedicated work and time, does anyone have any advice?  "

After becoming a finalist, any college(s) could pick you, but the highest ranking school that matches you is the school you must attend. \n\n1. Rice\n2. Yale \n3. UVA\n4. Washington and Lee -> MATCHED w/ a FULL RIDE!!\n5. College of Holy Cross\n6. Vanderbilt \n7. Northwestern\n8. Notre Dame\n9. UPenn\n10. Emory\n11. Swarthmore \n12. UChicago\n13. Davidson\n14. Macalester College\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nSince 8th grade, it was my goal to get the highest SAT/ACT score so that I could be successful. As you can see, my SAT score is not that impressive. But to me, my scores set a foundation to my growth in HS. Now, let\u2019s just forget AP Psych, I let the Soulja boy crank me on that one. But anyways, my scores challenged me to push myself in acedemics, extracurriculars, and leadership. \n\nI hope this post somewhat served at a confidence boost. You don\u2019t have to join every club in your school, I only did the ones I actually had interested in. And you don\u2019t have to be a Jack of all trades; dwell and expand on the hobbies you enjoy. \n\nAlso, if I sound out of touch with reality, my apologies, I haven\u2019t touched grass in a while.\n\nAnyways\u2026.I\u2019m just extremely grateful to God, my family and teachers for supporting me through this process. And best of luck to the class of 2025, y\u2019all got this!!!!"

My school does on a 10.0 scale, and it was 10.0 (9th-12th)\n- **Rank**: 1st / 543 \n- **# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.**: School didn\u2019t offer (actually you couldn\u2019t choose ANY clases but only \u201cinterest tracks,\u201d and I chose electronics). \n- **Senior Year Course Load**: Worth noting that out of 15 classes 7 were specialized in CS, Electronics and Project Management (same for sophomore and junior year).\n\n**Standardized Testing**:\n\n- SAT: 1550 (750 RW, 800 M) \n- IELTS: 8.0 (9.0 R, 8.5 L, 7.5 S, 7.0 W)\n\nTook them once (south american w/ no money lol). Super unexpected SAT result, literally jumped off my chair and when I got it. \n\n**Activities**: \n\n1. Team Captain @ Robotics Club: Independently created 4 mini-sumo competition robots. Competed w/university students & engineering professionals. \n\n2. Elected Vice-president of MUN Club: Organized 6 MUNs for 6300 students, Conf. President 6x; Best Delegate 3x, Hon.

Ministry Young Advisor: Discussed public policies, built official media campaigns (w/ 85k+ views), and co-developed a survey for city students w/ City Gov.  representatives.\n\n(this seems like something extremely selective but the Advisory had a 100% acceptance rate, It\u2019s just new and not well-known)\n\n8. Swimming, 13yrs (2yrs competitive); Handball, 2yrs; Volleyball, 2yr; Tennis, summer; Skiing, winter (120hs).\n\n(Zero 0 none accomplishments here though. Not even a single swim race \ud83d\udc80. But had very much fun doing them)\n\n9. Shared photos of DIY decor/furniture in my bedroom to prove low-budget aesthetic interior design is possible. Reached 1.700.000+ views & ~60+ countries.\n\n10. Built app to enhance small businesses' revenues & reduce food waste. Led team, pitched, & programmed front/back-end.\n\n(Hesitated to include it because we still didn\u2019t launch but idk)\n\nAs you can see ECs were not extremely focused or spiked but really did what I found interesting and fun! \n\n**Honors and awards**: \n\n1. Natn'l Olympiads: Physics, 3rd prize; Technology, 4th place (2200 partic.); Historic Research, 2nd place (143 papers)\n2. Natn'l Robotics League Mini-sumo category: Silver Medal @ [Location] & Bronze Medal @ [Location] \n3. [Name] South American writing competition: 1 of 25 Intn'l publications (2146 submissions) \n4. [Name] STEM Communication Awards: Intn'l winner + $400 scholarship\n5. [human-rights related] Literary Competition: Natn'l winner (370+ participants)\n\n- Living in a region without that big of a fierce competition came in handy for this section \ud83d\ude18 #blessed\n\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**: \n\nI think these were pretty good but not too sure. Read a bit of some and they were extremely flattering, and most 3+ pages long. \n\n- Physics teacher: 8.5/10 (helped me in Olympiads, helped teaching to the class, real bond with him)\n\n- Jewish studies teacher: 9/10 (my FAVOURITE classes, always told me to become a writer, helped me in my Holocaust Museum Gide position and inspired me to tackle projects regarding the Holocaust)\n\n- Headmaster of electronics track: 9/10 (Helped me establish many clubs, sent me to countless events/meeting to represent the school and really vibed with him. Known him for 3+ years). \n\n- Best friend: 9.5/10 (I KNOW THIS ATE as I literally did 1/2 of my ECs with him and I love him so much. HE ALSO WRITES EXTREMILY WELL so no doubt this helped)\n\n\n**Additional Information**: \n\nEveryone advised me to keep it VERY SIMPLE, but I really used it. \n\n1. All my MUN awards (2 Intn\u2019l, 2 natn\u2019l, 1 regional and 1 school, all through 4 years), mentioned a merit-based full ride I got for one of my country\u2019s best engineering unis, and an intn\u2019l award from Oxford Climate Change Challenge. \n2. Some programs and coding languages I experimented and/or worked with. \n3. I mentioned 4 extra ECs: a year-long Data Analyst Professional Certificate from IBM (by completing 9 online courses that I did in just 5 weeks), founding the Debate club and a School Spirit club, attending a fully-funded international online AI summer school for two weeks (3% acc. rate) and being selected to make a Ted Talk on technology at school (2% acc. rate for seniors). \n4. Some dotted descriptions of two independent engineering projects I made (technical stuff + objectives)\n5. My Linkedin link (I am somewhat active there)\n6. Clarified my Math level was Calc AB and that I worked on BC on Khan Academy for a bit.\n\n\n**Essays**: \n\n*Personal Statement*: 8.5/10. It took SUPER LONG but I actually loved it. Explored how I used writing and engineering to address the need to keep the memory of past Argentinian dictatorship kidnappings (which directly affected my family) and the Holocaust alive. \n\n*Supplementals*:\n- 9/10: Princeton, Brown and NYU\n- 8/10: Notre Dame, Lehigh and Williams\n- 7/10: Amherst, Dartmouth and W&L\n- 6/10: Harvard\n- 5/10: JHU, UPenn and Bowdoin (mentioned wrong school name \ud83d\udc80)\n- 4/10: Columbia and Stanford \n\nI didn\u2019t start any more than one week before deadline. I think 90% were done on the day (and ~50% on the hour before \ud83d\ude43)\n\n\n**Interviews**: TOO MANY \n\n- Bowdoin: 5.5/10 - My first and yapped too much \n- Stanford: 6/10 - Didn\u2019t know a single thing about the school, but I was pretty happy with most of my answers. \n- Princeton: 9/10 - I feel I really shined through and vibed with my interviewer. \n- UPenn: 10/10 - Hands down the best conversation of my LIFE. Super interesting. \n- Yale: 7.5/10 - Senior interview, could\u2019ve been better but I was in vacay lol\n- NYU: 8.5/10 - Short but super sweet. \n- Dartmouth: 8/10 - Started rough ended super good!\n- W&L Johnson Finalist: 7/10 - Weird questions but felt I navigated them somewhat nicely. \n\nAs you can see by comparing the results I got from schools that interviewed me and those that didn\u2019t, I think most interviews really played in my favor \ud83d\ude04 being a debate kid really came in handy here. \n\n\n**Decisions** (REA/EA/ED/RD):\n\n**ACCEPTED** : \n\n- >!Washington and Lee + Johnson Scholar (full merit scholarship + 10k stipend)!<\n- >!Bowdoin + Faculty Scholars (full financial aid scholarship + 3k stipend)!<\n - >!NYU Abu Dhabi (tuition + room financial aid scholarship)!<\n\n\n**WAITLISTED**:\n\n- >!Princeton (later rejected)!<\n- >!Columbia (later rejected)!<\n- >!UPenn (later rejected)!<  \n- >!Brown (later rejected)!<  \n- >!Dartmouth (later rejected)!<\n- >!Williams (later rejected)!<\n\nI later found out how internationals asking for financial aid have virtually 0% chances on waitlists so I guess expected.\n\n\n**REJECTIONS**:\n\n- Stanford (rejected REA)\n- Harvard\n- Yale\n- Johns Hopkins\n- Amherst\n- Notre Dame\n- Lehigh\n- Case Western Reserve\n\n\n**PRE-DECISION REFLECTION** (only knowing about Stanford): I only applied to universities that would beat a full ride to my fav university in my country so pretty ambitious elections (no safeties or matches!). I decided to apply abroad pretty late for the standard I saw (April 2023), and involved a LOT of familiarization with the process. If I don\u2019t get anywhere still I DONT REGRET IT FOR A SECOND: I learnt more english, to manage legal documents and resumes, contact people all over the world,  enhanced writing skills, A LOT OF SELF DISCOVERY AND REFLECTION and controlling challenging deadlines. It also brought me a lot closer to God somehow, and I learnt to at least aim to put my worries in Jesus and trust that everything will go as it should!!! When I was rejected I thought about giving up applying anywhere else (not being even DEFFERED hit somewhat hard), but pretty happy that I continued!!! Now we\u2019ll have to see, but I deeply believe any decision will be for the better. \n\n**POST-DECISION REFLECTION**: I am honestly so surprised and happy with my decisions!!! (I am literally getting paid to go!!). I really realized how difficult it is for full-aid seeking internationals to even secure ONE university. I know 30+ EXTREMELY TALENTED PEOPLE (perfect GPA, valedictorians, 1450+ SAT, amazing ECs) from my country applying for full-rides in the U.S. and only ~5 got one. So I\u2019m super grateful for the three opportunities and the waitlists!! I\u2019m having a hard time choosing where to go, but honestly super blessed I even get to choose. And now I see how important it is to shotgun to 15+ places for aid seeking internationals! \n\n[UPDATE] \u2014> I chose Washington and Lee!! Go generals \ud83d\udc99"

Lowkey this project is probably the reason why I had such low grades comparatively to the fact that I got 5s and am really good at math and shit.\n\nAccepted: ASU\n\nWaitlisted: UW Madison(Hoping I get off the waitlist for this since I really really want to go here), U-Mass Amherst, UC Santa Cruz(close to home so I also hope I get off), UC Riverside, MIT(!!!), CMU(def not getting off for last two\ud83d\udc80)\n\nRejected: Purdue, UMD, UIUC, Literally every UC except the ones listed above, UT Austin, U Wash(Idk why I applied to these since these were basically a guarunteed rejection knowing my stats and their in-state bias), SJSU\n\nI honestly think that for Madison and Amherst, I applied at the wrong time. If I went during the early action cycle, I probably would've gotten these two. Additionally, I should've applied for VA Tech and A&M since these are decent as well. And honestly,  MIT/CMU waitlist is probably a mix of luck, time spent on essays, and my Game Engine EC which I really highlighted for these two colleges, so these were a huge surprise to me, especially since I did reg for CMU and EA-Deferral->Waitlist for MIT.\n\nFinally, speaking about my app as a whole, for any people reading this who are in like sophmore and junior year, PLEASE focus on grades, even if it pains you and you wanna do smthng else. guess what, i did smthng else and when it made my grades suffer, every other part of my app suffered. Honestly, regardless of where I go, including the ones Im hoping to get off the waitlist for, I'm probably gonna try to transfer after a year or two to the top 5 CS colleges.\n\nRemember kids, don't be on the edge like I am, because you'll probably end up like me, with a lot of rejections and not many good options to choose from). Also, pick more from the 20-30-40 ranges of colleges. IDK why I didn't do this cuz I probably would've been accepted to most of them."

Member of a college-level scholar program that provides internships with pay. I am one of the only high school students. Obtained two internships at different companies with this program. The program also provides a place for networking that allows for more job opportunities in the future.\n2. President of inaugural Diversity and Inclusion committee at HS. Organized many events and school-wide educational sessions.\n3. Founder of a club that teaches students about literature from around the world.\n4. A teacher aide for a program that gives enrichment opportunities for mainly neurodivergent kids. I\u2019ve been volunteering for this program since middle school and have amassed almost 400 hours.\n5. Member of a yearly local program that showcases youth\u2019s artwork and other forms of expression in regard to identity and certain themes. I organized the events and decided which themes the students should center their art around.\n6. Part of a varsity sports team, all four years, and selected to be a co-captain for this year.\n7. Member of a local program part of the legal system in my area which prevents children from committing crimes through interventions.\n8. A volunteer for a program that makes it possible for low-income students to attend local private schools. The program prepared students for entrance exams, classes, etc.\n\nAwards/Honors\n\n1. College Board National African American Recognition Scholar\n2. Multiple regional scholastic gold keys in creative writing\n3. An award given to one junior-year student yearly for commitment to community, kindness, and academic merit\u00a0\n4. School-level Chinese Honor Society member\n5. High Honor Roll all four years\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nEnglish teacher (9/10): I had this teacher for two years (small school) and often talked with him to discuss my essays, English literature, and more. He has always expressed to my parents how fond he is of me, and was very happy when I asked if he could write my letter of recommendation. I think it went well !\n\nHistory Teacher (9/10): I had this teacher for history for sophomore and junior year, and then was also my senior advisor. Pretty similar sentiments to my last teacher, so I\u2019ll say it went well.\n\nInterviews\n\nI got to do an interview at Swarthmore, Bowdoin, and WashU. I think my best interview definitely was Bowdoin: the interviewer was very happy that I was interested in the college and was really hoping I ED\u2019d. The other interviews were average, atleast to my perspective.\n\nEssays\n\nI spent my whole summer before senior year writing my essay, and I was really deadset on what I wanted to write about. I talked about a specific interest that I had (specifically a certain food) and I used it as an extended metaphor to compare it with other struggles I\u2019ve experienced in my life. The essay DID NOT, however, focus on those struggles. I highlighted how I use one specific instance to motivate me in everything I do, etc. It sounds a bit bland because I\u2019m trying to be very vague, but the specific topic was niche enough where I think it sparked interest.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* Washington University in St. Louis (ED, full-tuition merit scholarship!)\n* University of St. Andrews (Rolling decision, it\u2019s in Scotland so different process, got in for 4 year International Relations program)\n* Fordham University (EA, full tuition merit scholarship)\n* Howard University (EA)\n* Indiana University, Bloomington (EA)\n* Ohio State University (EA, got some merit scholarships)\n\nWithdrawn:\n\n* Northeastern University (EA)\n* Emory University (RD, submitted before ED decision)\n* Swarthmore College (RD, submitted before ED decision)\n* Williams College (RD, submitted before ED decision)\n* Colgate University (RD, submitted before ED decision)\n\nIntended to apply RD, but didn\u2019t after ED acceptance:\n\n* Amherst College\n* Bowdoin College\n* John Hopkins University\n* George Washington University\n* Pomona College\n* Princeton University\n* Rice University\n* University of Pennsylvania\n* Yale University\n\nRejections:\n\n* None!\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nIt was really tough for me to decide where I wanted to ED, as I was choosing between WashU and an Ivy. **I ultimately decided, after visiting both campuses, that my \u2018quality of life\u2019 and overall enjoyment would be greater at WashU for my specific interests.** This was a crazy journey, but I\u2019m more than happy with how it turned out."

Wrestling - Won 2 small state-wide tournaments, 5th at a larger tournament, 2x state qualifier, team captain, not good enough for recruiting. I spent 10+ hours a week in practice and 2+ hours in duals and tournaments. This was my favorite activity, spent so much time practicing.\n\n2. Marching Band - Played marching baritone. Just for fun, team won some state level awards, but no leadership for me.\n3. Organic Chemistry Research - Conducted synthetic design and synthetic methods optimization for isothiocyanate/isocyanate functionalization of free amine amino acids. Old chemistry, but it was needed for specific conditions required for subsequent nanopore analysis.\n\n4. Statistical Analysis & \u201csoftware-design\u201d for Nanopore project - Did some 2D parametric/nonparametric clustering analysis for height/Dwell-time analysis of amino acid time peaks in Nanopore current traces. Did majority of statistical analysis for proof-of-concept paper. Also developed a software for future project in MATLAB appdesigner (\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22) for automatic peak extraction & analysis. Ultimately, was a middle author on 2 papers in two pretty high impact/citations papers.\n\n5. Chemistry Club - Started a chemistry club at my school (partnered with my chemistry professor dad \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d academic nepotism), where we would do some fun lectures in gen/orgo/analytical/physical chemistry along with experiments and activities. In second year, my school had 3 students in the top three at the local chemistry olympiad, and 2 students compete in the national chemistry olympiad, and only 1 (me) the year before. Had 10+ people. Pretty fun and I enjoyed coming back during college to teach and tutor. \n\n6. Musical Instruments - Practiced piano, guitar, and Euphonium weekly. Helped me decompress. Really just screwed around playing songs I wanted to play. Euphonium was for school concert band, and I still play in college.\n\n7. Weightlifting - Started lifting 10+ hours a week in sophomore year. Got pretty strong, 225 bench, 365 squat, 385 deadlift at 140 lb weight class. I wrote an essay abt lifting during COVID, which was an enjoyable essay to write.\n\n8. College classes (at UofSC, auditing with grading which I was fortunate enough to do because of my Dad) - I took Gen Chem I/II in 7th grade, Orgo I/II in 8th grade, Calc-based physics in 9th grade, Analytical Chem/Biochem/Biomedical Engineering Techniques in 10th grade, Multivariable Calculus in 12th grade summer\n \n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. Wrestling - 2 tournament wins, 1 5th place, 1 1st place at state qualifying tournament\n\n2. Chemistry Olympiad - 4x first place at local chemistry olympiad, 3x top 154 in national, 1x top 54 in national\n\n3. Subway student athlete of the year - $2,500 scholarship and interview\n\n4. National Merit Scholarship - $2,500 scholarship\n\n5. Regional science fair - placed either 3rd or honorable mention\n\n6. All state band freshman year, Regional band senior year (skipped auditions sophomore and junior years due to wrestling)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n \nAP Chem teacher (idk/10) - started chemistry club with her, fell asleep in her class all the time though\n\nAP Calc (idk/10) - she was pretty cool, i was youngest in her class and goofed off a lot.\n\nAP Lit (10/10) - loved her, super easy class, spent the whole time analyzing books from material dialectic view\n\nResearch PI (100/10) - lowkey wrote the entire thing myself\n\n**Interviews**\nDidn\u2019t get an interview!\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nI didn\u2019t write a PS. MIT essays focused on wrestling, research, lifting, and music. Wrote a fun essay abt watching Chinese olympic weightlifters (Lu xiaojun) on youtube. CalTech essays were focused on research and wrestling. I wrote about the things that mattered to me, even if they weren\u2019t super flowery.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\nMIT (EA)\nUofSC (EA) - full-ride, top scholar program (top ~100 students in state, parking, dorm choice, class priority, etc)\n\n*Waitlists:*\nNone\n\n*Rejections:*\nCalTech (EA) - no deferral\n\n**Additional Information:**\n \nI applied in junior year fall (the year before) and was waitlisted so I reused/edited some essays for senior year fall. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to post this because there is a prevailing narrative on this subreddit and others that East Asians are somehow victim to a \u201creverse-racism\u201d and blame Black, Indigenous, and Latine applicants for their lack of admissions to top schools rather than there just being a ton of  privileged people like me out there. At the end of the day, there is a way to acknowledge hard work and privilege without trivializing the immense social and material barriers to higher educational access for marginalized communities.

I have committed to Princeton, and it definitely is the best fit for me. College results this year were very random, but I couldn\u2019t be more thankful to get into the #1 undergraduate university. I was worried that since most of my application was MIT-related (Research, classes, Letters of Rec, Awards, Activities), other universities would think I was going there and reject me. College results were super random and stressful, but it worked out better than I could have ever imagined. It's funny how I got waitlisted and rejected from all my target schools (Vandy, UMich, USC) but then got into most of my reach schools.\n\n**Advice for Future Applicants:**\n\nBe authentic. There is no formula that gets you in. Sure, you have to do a couple of things like getting good grades and SAT scores and having some unique activities and awards, but especially for Top 10 schools, you just have to be unique and authentic. I didn't have any connections or background (like private school and college counselor) that provided me with opportunities. I was literally the first kid ever from my school to get into Princeton. I was authentic and hardworking, did stuff I enjoyed, and one thing led to another. I also spent a lot of time on essays and my application. 50% of the work is actually doing stuff, and the other 50% is showcasing it in your college application. Also, have balance in life. I had a lot of fun in high school and enjoyed the stuff I did. Live life with no regrets. Feel free to DM me."

I started working on the music since junior year and had a few professionals on my instrument give feedback on my recordings. So my final submission was hopefully really strong. In the portfolios I also included band director rec letter, which hopefully was really good because of my leadership as drum major.\n\nPlease help me decide Harvard vs. Stanford because I got off the waitlist and need to decide fast. I\u2019m not set on what I want to do, but it would either be quant, startup, or ML work at a tech company. Leaning on remaining committed to Stanford, but still considering Harvard for be"

I ended up going to my safety state school, and was absolutely crushed by the rejections I received and the fact that I wasn't going to end up at the type of school I had previously envisioned for myself. Fast forward to half a year-ish later, I decided to shoot my shot at transferring - and here are my results! \n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: Female\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian\n* Residence: West\n* Income Bracket: Upper middle class\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None\n* Type of school: State school (not very highly ranked, but not on the bottom end either)\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: UChicago - Biology & History, Social Studies, and Philosophy of Medicine, Duke - Biology, Cornell - Biology & Science and Technology Studies, Brown - Biology & Science, Technology, and Society, UPenn - Biology & Science and Technology Studies\n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA (UW/W): HS GPA - 3.9/4.8 // College GPA - 4.0\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\nIncluded most HS ECs from previous post and the following college ECs: \n\n* Social media editor and writer for student newspaper\n* Research assistant for a lab on campus\n* Member of college book club\n* Participated in medical volunteering/outreach club, aiding homeless populations in community \n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nIncluded most HS awards from previous post and Dean's list from college. \n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nGot rec letters from 2 professors I had in my first semester of college. I only had them for one semester, so I imagine it wouldn't be the strongest letter they've ever written - but I made a genuine effort to connect with these profs outside of class! \n\n**Essays**\n\nIn contrast to the way I approached my first-year applications, I actually did not have anyone look over my supplemental essays. I did have my profs, parents, and a graduate student writing tutor look over my \"why transfer\" essay (which is the equivalent of the common app essay for transfer admissions) - but mostly for grammar and clarity, and not for changing the content. \n\n**Interviews**\n\nI was not offered any transfer interviews! \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n* Duke -> Rejected\n* UChicago -> Accepted!\n* Cornell -> Accepted! (Non transfer option) \n* Brown -> Accepted!\n* UPenn -> Rejected\n\n**Reflection/Additional thoughts:**\n\nFor current seniors who may not have had the best college admissions cycle, I hope my experience shows that your life does not end with college rejections! Ironically, I might not end up leaving my state school. Since applying to transfer, I've really fallen in love with the school and have found so many enriching educational and professional opportunities. If your cycle didn't go the way you wanted, there's always to transfer elsewhere or succeed wherever you end up! "

His writing is not the best tho so not a 10/10\n\nEngineering Teacher: 8/10. Had him for 3 years and was part of his club for all of them. Can speak to my abilities super well. He moved districts before my senior year so didn\u2019t see him for a bit but still pretty good regardless\n\nProfessor: 9/10. Interned under him over the summer and he trusted my capabilities a lot.

Going EA was super helpful. If you need to miss a school assignment or 2, you can make that up. Sometimes to have to have to wager your present for the sake of your future. This process can really suck at times but it\u2019s manageable in the end. "

I had five dream schools (brown, ucla, washu, northwestern, and georgetown) and ended up getting rejected from all of them which was both a total punch in the gut and a much needed wake up call. the decision for me based on fit and financials came down to maryland, washington, and davis, and as a result of the really generous merit aid i recieved at umd as well as the university's perfect location near washington DC, it was just the perfect fit. After visiting the school, I totally fell in love with the campus, the culture, and having a big 10 sports program definitely didn't hurt it. looking back on everything, i was totally na\u00efve and applied to a ton of  schools, which thankfully worked out for my targets, but i was at one point certain that i would get into at least one of my reaches. in the end, im really glad that i didnt get into any of them because i would have never considered maryland, a school i almost didnt even apply to. also, as a jewish student, the thriving jewish community on maryland's campus is really comforting, especially with everything going on right now at colleges. congrats to all of this years seniors and good luck to all the incoming seniors with their apps! and if youre going to maryland next year, hmu!!!!<"

I hated this because I did it last summer and I had to wake up at like 5am to join meetings as the company is based in Asia T\\_T\n7. manager at a cafe. SUPER FUN OMG it took like 15-20 hours of my week every week since junior year but I loved my job. it was definitely my fav ec ever and I genuinely grew so much as a person from working. HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting a job if you can, the extra money is nice too <3\n8. president of an interest club at my school (think like art, crochet, board games, etc) basically a club for a hobby. dont wanna be specific. but it was one of the biggest clubs in the school.\n9. varsity LD debate. I really only debated for like freshman, soph, half of junior year but I judged a lot of tournaments and wrote cases/cut cards for my team after that. kinda hated debate towards the end.\n10. invested money into businesses in 3rd world countries and helped them to grow/expand their profit; received high returns. I used some of my income from my job for this. didn't take much time, was mostly a side thing\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. diamond challenge finalist- top 50/700+ global teams (basically this is a pitching competition)\n2. taekwondo black belt, ITF \n3. deca state qualifier grades 9,10,11 (LOL I SUCKED AT DECA) \n4. national merit commended (I sold on the psat bruh)\n5. league of legends plat (dont make fun of me I literally had NO other honors)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\ncalculus bc teacher- 6/10 me and him were pretty good friends id say? we would joke around and make fun of my other friend in class. he knew I was a hard worker and smart, but I wouldn't say we were super close.\n\napush teacher- 7/10 I actually read this one haha (she sent it to me). I really love her, and I genuinely liked apush and would participate in class to an extent. I wouldn't say its the BEST letter out there but It was decent and nice <3\n\npiano teacher- 8/10 she has known me since I was 5 and I LOVE this woman. she is the sweetest person ever, seen me grow through the years. she also let me read her letter, so I know that it was really sweet and honestly quite beautiful.\n\ncounselor rec- 5/10 I think my counselor lowkey hated me. he was opping me so hard at the beginning of the year abt my schedule, and I had to fight him a few years ago to take bc without having taken ab calc LOL. I dont think it would have trashed me, but he has definitely written better letters for people.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI only had a few interviews and ironically I didn't get into any of the colleges I interviewed for LMAO\n\ngeorgetown- 8/10, I think me and my interviewer def clicked and I thought my responses accurately presented myself how I wanted to. he was super chill though, and he told me I would do great wherever I go <3 \n\npenn- 2/10, my interview was like 20 minutes long bruh. the guy was reading off a list of questions, he didn't really ask my like follow up questions on anything. I liked my answers for the most part but I dont think the overall interview was very good.\n\nmit- 8/10, i REALLY liked this interview, I had a lot of really great responses and me and him clicked over liking boba lol. I also kinda gave him an idea about his professional life so maybe points for that?\n\nprinceton- 7/10, the guy was super chill and young so it was much easier to talk to him. it was kinda weird tho he emailed me asking for a photo of myself so he could recollect his memory a few days after the interview? idk man but he seemed nice and he sent me what he wrote. was kinda a mid report but not anything bad so w\n\ndartmouth- 6.5/10, she was also young. she also just read off a list of a few questions, not really any follow up. interview was 25ish minutes and we didn't really connect although I thought I had decent responses.\n\n**Essays**\n\ncommonapp essay- 8.5-9/10. it was about my relationship with a family member, and I really REALLy liked this essay. it was probably the most genuine and raw thing I've written, and I got it reviewed by a few trusted adults. one lady told me that I shouldn't submit this essay, but I felt like honestly writing anything else would not represent myself as truly as this did. im glad I stuck to my gut haha\n\nuc essays-6/10 i hated these essays with a PASSION I hated how I wrote them, I wrote about the most BASIC things ever (like the talent essay I wrote about freaking music. like bruh every asian is gonna write about music). idk what any uc saw in these lol\n\nsupps- 7-9/10 I wrote about some really quirky shit for a lot of them, I had to grind all my rd apps the 2 weeks of winter break after getting rejected from penn ed haha. was not fun dont recommend DO UR APPS BEFORE AND DONT EGO IT LIKE ME \n\nhonestly for essays, just stay true to yourself. dont try to be someone else, dont say things because you think they will get you in. to some extent, yes you have to do that- but if you genuinely believe in yourself or something you've written, stick to your guts.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* ed- penn (wharton) (got straight up rejected ed)\n* ea- mit (business) (deferred ea-> rejected rd)\n* rd- every single ivy- applied econ or business to all \n* rd- georgetown (business)\n* rd- northwestern (engineering)\n* rd- uchicago (business economics)\n* rd- johns hopkins (biomedical engineering)\n* rd- stanford (econ) ngl after ivy day this was my last hope and it genuinely crushed me when I got rejected haha\n\n\n\n\n* *Waitlists:*\n\n* umich (lsa/business)\n* nyu (stern)\n* ucsb (forgot what I applied for ngl)\n* williams (econ)\n\nwithdrew all my waitlists except for duke as I wouldn't pick any of them over berkeley.\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* ea- texas a&m (engineeering)\n* ea- ut san antonio (econ)\n* ea- ut austin (business)\n* ea- iu kelley (business)\n* ea- uva (I applied business but I think you reapply after a year, so I was admitted to the l&s college I think)\n* ea- usc (business) (applied ea, got deferred, then accepted rd)\n* rd- vanderbilt (engineering w/ $6k stipend)\n* rd- ucsd (engineering)\n* rd- ucla (business economics)\n* rd- uc berkeley (got in to l&s) \n* rd- duke (biomedical engineering) initially waitlisted--> accepted --> attending!\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI know imma sound like a fuckin loser nerd typical senior who got into a t10 and suddenly has 'wisdom' but like genuinely. this process is so fucked up and weird and you genuinely dont know how tf its gonna turn out. I applied to WAY too many colleges, and ended up having to rush them all haha. I guess it worked out in the end and I would LOWKEY recommend shotgunning but If you do decide to shotgun please don't do what I did. \n\nI was initially committed to berkeley, and at first I was super upset. I know that sounds stupid, but for someone who has had their eyes set on the Ivy League/t10's since she was 5, it was genuinely upsetting. I remember literally bawling my eyes out on the airport floor when I got all my rejections one after the other on ivy day because I was so upset haha. I understand what it feels like, but honestly after a few weeks I felt much better and was actually excited to go to berkeley (I literally JUST bought merch too LMAO). like the college you go to is really what you make of it, and yes I know its not like I was going to squidward cc, but even berkeley felt like it wasnt enough for all the blood, sweat, tears I had poured in over the years. but things happen for a reason, and I do think I would have been 100% happy at berkeley had I not gotten off the duke waitlist (I had literally 0 hope for it, I wrote the shittiest LOCI ever too LOL). I know im kind of rambling, but basically this process doesn't define you and you can and will find reasons to be happy at the college that you get into and decide to go to. I know it feels like life is ending but everything will work out eventually, even if you don't see it now. be proud of where you go, and happy that those people saw your value and wanted to admit you. \n\n  \nif anyone has any questions def lmk! my dm's are open <3 and if you think you know me, no you don't"

Alot of people who have read it, including 2 english teachers and 2 counselors, have loved it and gave me no feedback on it telling me not to change a thing. but on the other hand it was harshly critiqued by some current college students. re-reading it i feel like i could've done a better job, and maybe i'm a little disappointed but i might be too hard on myself after being influenced by others opinions. the one thing i'm certain about tho is its attention-grabbing, funny, and unconventional.\n\n**Supplements:**\u00a0Varied by school but i think mostly 8/10 or even dare i say some were 9/10. i loved alot of my RD supplements, my EA supplements were good but i think i really got the hang of writing by RD time.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* Pitt w/ guaranteed law school + deans law scholarship (rolling)\n* Fordham w/ merit scholarship (EA)\n* Indiana w/ kelley direct admit + dean's scholarship (EA)\n* Umiami w/ president\u2019s scholarship  (EA)\n* Northeastern (EA)\n* Rutgers (honors program) (RD)\n* George Washington University + president's scholarship (RD)\n* American University + president's scholarship + cornerstone program (RD)\n* Syracuse + 2 merit scholarships (RD)\n* UC Davis (RD)\n* UC Santa Barbara w/ likely letter/early notice through Chancellor's invite (RD)\n* UC San Diego (RD)\n* Boston University (RD)\n* NYU (RD) middle school me's dream but too expensive!\n* Barnard (off the waitlist!) also one of my dream schools \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n* Cornell deferred ED -> (basically guaranteed) Transfer Option!! ik this isn't exactly an acceptance but putting this in this category bc a win is a win!

I hope this can give some hope to people who are test optional or don't have the best stats bc I really think it was my ECs and essays that helped me the most.\n\nI didn't even apply to Harvard bc all these college apps had me burnt out and I maxed out my common app but watch out Harvard law \ud83d\udd1c! what, like its hard? thanks elle woods for motivating me through this application cycle \ud83d\ude17\n\nnow plsssss help me decide, I only have a day left to respond to my barnard waitlist and I don't know what to do!\n\nbarnard was such a dream for me, but so was cornell! before my barnard waitlist, I was planning on going to Rutgers for my first year bc it was the cheapest and then using my transfer option to do my next 3 years at cornell. at barnard, I get the best of both worlds w the city at my disposal and the resources of columbia + a tight knit women's community and a full four year college experience that I wouldn't get with the transfer option. but barnard is 60k more for the first year in comparison to Rutgers, and while the costs are the same for the rest of the 3 idk If I can justify 60k since it'll be a financial strain for my family and I could rather save money for law school If if go. with Rutgers + Cornell, I like my major in Cornell's ILR School more and the academic opportunities more + save lots of money, I just don't know how I feel abt transferring."

Got a letter of rec from my mentor thanks to this! I also ended up getting to co-author publications thanks to this, but neither are fully published yet (probably hurt me in the admissions process bc I could only say they were submitted)\u00a0\n\n2 - Varsity Badminton Captain, four year starter, #1 doubles ranking in my school. I'm also a volunteer counselor at the summer badminton camp for our school. Named top 15 players in my region (Long Island). While I was on the team, we also were the County Champs runner ups, 2x League Champions, and created history by reaching the County Finals for both the boys and girls team (can you tell i love badminton)\n\n3 - Organized weekly community badminton training sessions at the local YMCA for the past three years. I also help train current and prospective Varsity players alongside my doubles partner, and actively train at a badminton center where I participate in tournaments. Honestly, despite all the high school stuff, I still have a lot to improve at in this sport. Hopefully I'll find time in college.\n\n4 - Varsity Fencing (for the school), we won League and County Championships, and were 2nd on Long Island. I was a starter for foil. I only did this for a year, but was still a ton of fun.\n\n5 - Competitive Swimming (7 years) - competed in independent swim clubs, I qualified for this huge meet in Maryland that got cancelled cuz of COVID... then I quit swimming bc it made me depressed. Go figure.\n\n6 - Marching Band Drum Major (and former trumpet section leader), I did Marching Band all four years of HS, I also help run the Pep Band during the off-season and got featured on a local newspaper!\u00a0\n\n7 - High School Select Ensembles - 2nd chair trumpet player, 1st chair pianist, and tenor for Wind Ensemble, Pit Orchestra (School Musical), Chamber Chorus, Jazz Band, and Jazz Messengers (smaller version of Jazz Band and invite only, we play at fundraisers and community events, we got featured on local news once, that was cool) I had to audition to join each of these ensembles, and had 2 hr rehearsals for each of them once a week after school. Thank goodness they were all on different days and didn't overlap too much. Concert nights were brutal tho but I love music so what can I say.\n\n8 - TRI-M Music Honor Society President... except I actually had to do a lot of work - reached out to local elderly homes and community library to organize music events where students could sign up to perform in the community. (I've been president for two years, a member ever since 7th grade)\u00a0\n\n9 - President's Council - Student government group, but only for presidents of honor societies - we often go to leadership conferences and we meet with building administration to pretty much give input on things we can improve within the school. We also organize an annual festival at the end of the school year (we literally cancel class and organize events for students to go to instead, so it's like a huge community-oriented celebration)\n\n10 - Chinese Culture - I've been attending a Chinese School that rents out a building at a local university, where I've been learning Chinese since kindergarten (I'm fluent now). I also was a TA for the Children's Chorus at the Chinese school, sang Peking Opera and Chinese music at annual performances, was a master of ceremony for some of those very same performances, and briefly hosted some episodes of the Chinese School Children's Podcast. I also went to a culture exchange camp in China (summer before COVID) where I performed a Peking Opera piece and got interviewed by a local CCTV news station. I was extremely privileged to even get that opportunity, as my Chinese school had offered it to us all-expenses paid. \n\n  \n**Essay/Letter of Rec:**\n\nCommon App Essay on activity #3 (Community Badminton), I made it very cute, our group was named the Badminton Besties and I talked about how I wanted to promote the sport more within the school and community, and the challenges I had to overcome before settling down at the YMCA, and how I never originally expected to be asked to train other people but slowly began to appreciate it. \n\nNot the greatest essay though - this essay will neither make nor break my application, but badminton is definitely a unique topic for me.\n\nMath Teacher LoR: He wrote a lot of LoRs, I think his letter is good but not outstanding or anything. 6.5/10\n\nBand Teacher LoR: I've known her for four years, she cooked rlly hard on her letter however I prioritized her letter lower bc music isn't a \"core\" subject. 9/10\n\nStanford Alumni LoR: He was the attending doctor and my mentor for research when I was at MSK. 10/10\n\nCounselor LoR: Better than the math teachers LoR I think, me and my counselor are pretty tight. 8.5/10\n\n**Supplements:**\n\nI slaved away for hours and hours each week to write them. Of course I was then able to repurpose them for many schools (THANK GOD) Overall, solid 7/10, just felt like some of them didn't make me stand out enough, but I just wrote about things that genuinely showcased me as a person.\n\n  \n**Interviews**\n\nMIT- 10/10 loved by interviewer, he was a older guy with a lot of great stories to tell. We chatted for like 3 hours inside the Panera until the sun set. Great guy!\n\nPrinceton - 8/10 really nice interviewer who was a doctor at a hospital not far away from me. We talked about Princeton's clubs, campus life, and webtoons!\n\nUPenn- 8/10 my interviewer was a really young student who just graduated, he showed me his pet cat (it climbed in front of his camera lol), talked a lot about our favorite foods \n\nHarvard- 6/10 it was ok, my interviewer was nice but clearly not very interested. He was a masters graduate from Harvard, not undergrad, so it was kinda hard to talk to him and ask him questions about what the undergrad experience was like. He also sort of just rapid fired questions at me. \n\nStanford - 8/10 super cool dude, this guy was so well rounded and I got to talk to him about my math IA (he was really into math), what the food and student life in Palo Alto was like, sports, and music. \n\nDuke - 7.5/10 interviewer responded to my email 3 hours before the actual interview... we did it by phone call instead of via Zoom, and ig Duke interviews are only 30 minutes long, unlike the other ones which were around 45 minutes. However, the actual interview went REALLY well, it was clear she just understood me. I talked about the things that truly made me happy, like jazz and badminton. I talked about how I enjoyed science research a lot, particularly presenting (which many people probably dread). She talked about the Duke student life with me a lot, and we got through a lot of stuff in 30 minutes! \n\nThe only weird thing was that she asked me where I ED'd to (nowhere), and asked me what my top choice was. I actually took a HUGE risk with my answer - I told her that Duke was one of my top 3 schools, but in no particular order because I don't feel like there's only one school where I can be happy, successful, or satisfied at. Duke was one of those schools to me, one where the weather, student life, campus, and academics are great, and that it was a school I could try imagine myself (something I could not say for many of the colleges I applied to). I think she genuinely appreciated the honesty though.\n\n\\*\\*Final thing about Duke's interviews - apparently not everyone gets interviews anymore, and they are given only to students they need more information for\\*\\*\n\n**Decisions**\n\n**\\*\\*I DID NOT ED ANYWHERE, and all schools were RD unless specified EA\\*\\***\n\n*Rejections*\n\n* All ivies I applied to (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, UPenn, Cornell, Columbia)\n* Stanford\n* MIT\n* Northeastern (deferred EA -> rejected RD)\n* USC (deferred EA -> rejected RD)\n* NYU \n* UC Berkeley\n* UC Santa Barbara\n\n*Waitlists*\n\n* UCLA \n* UC Irvine (Withdrew)\n* Boston University (Withdrew)\n\n*Acceptances*\n\n* Duke (waitlisted -> accepted)\n* UMich LSA Honors (Accepted EA)\n* UC San Diego\n* Rutgers with 15k scholarship (Accepted EA)\n* Fordham with 45k scholarship (Accepted EA)\n* University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) with 8k a year (Accepted EA)\n* SUNY Bing with 5k a year (Accepted EA)\n* SUNY Buffalo with 5k a year \n\n13 rejections, 3 waitlists, and 8 acceptances later... I am now committed to Duke Trinity College of Arts and Sciences for biology!!! (Originally committed to UMich but withdrew)\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAll you need is one! I was incredibly lucky to have gotten off the Duke waitlist, as it was my top choice after getting rejected from the other schools. I was already satisfied going to UMich, but now that Duke accepted me, go Blue Devils! \n\nTo all high school students out there stressing about college - remember that you define your own worth, and that in the end, you should attend a university that is both financially a good fit, but also a school that you know you will be happy at. I know that for me, comparison was the biggest thief of joy. Don't let yourself get dragged down too much by the accomplishments of others, because everyone moves at their own pace. However, if you put in the time and effort, results will inevitably follow. I was a good student, but never the smartest. It took me hours upon hours to studying to get the SAT score I wanted, and a lot of the time I spent on my ECs and internship came at the cost of my relationships with friends and family.\n\nGood luck to everyone!! If you have questions for me, please feel free to reach out and DM!!"

        "post": "Advice pls (long post sorry) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nI thought I'd be having my decision by this time but apparently not. I'm interested in EE and CS applications in physics (aerospace, quantum computing, etc.) I'll probably end up doing at least a Masters for sure (idk whether right after bachelors or a little bit after -> ideally want a company to pay for it) and potentially PhD/MBA if that's where my career path will take me. I\u2019m interested in exploring more research-based companies and start-ups rather than BigTech or quant, but, in general, I don't think academia is for me.\n\nBerkeley pros:\n\n* Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship bringing my COA down to cali in state tuition. Get preferred housing, class registration, etc. Additionally, financials were updated with better loans today. Anticipate a debt of \\~$50K over 4 years.\n* SEED Scholarship providing me $10K annual stipend for research.\n* Though there's supposedly \"deflation\", I think the requirements are much easier to complete than Caltech, and most students I talked to were able to finish the degree earlier and either do double major or 4+1 Masters program but in 4 years total.\n\nBerkeley cons:\n\n* Not a big fan of public schools as I feel as if I might get lost.\n* As an OOS student I have concerns whether I'll be able to fit in with existing friend groups from cali. At least in my state flagship, many ppl going are already really close friends with each other from high school, and weekends are often empty with students going back home.\n* I feel like I'll be fighting a lot more for opportunities (1720 EECS undergrad vs 1000 undergrad\u00a0**total**\u00a0at Caltech). I've heard cutthroat culture is prevalent.\n* Not a big fan of urban city colleges.\n* Gender ratio\u00a0at EECS\u00a0(I'm a woman) :/\n\nCaltech pros:\n\n* Ngl I liked the culture and ppl a lot more. I attended their host program and they really sold me on the school. I don't really care that much about \"traditional\" experiences and would rather just chill with friends.\n* Can't do an EECS double major but they do have a specific track in EE w/CS minor, which is pretty similar to what I want to do at Berkeley.\n* I really like the individualized attention and many more opportunities I'll get. Seems like most students are doing fine in terms of internships, fellowships, etc. even when the market is like this.\n* Research is much more accessible and undergrads (I've heard) have a little more autonomy compared to other schools.\n* I love how collaborative (and non-toxic) it is.\n\nCaltech cons:\n\n* More expensive but not full pay. Gave more aid than all the ivies and ivy pluses that I got into. Will have to take more loans than berkeley, and anticipate a debt of \\~$150K over 4 years.\n* There's BS/MS for EE, but I heard it's really rare to continue with masters at Caltech if you had done undergrad there. High chances they'll tell me to go somewhere else."

BUT he remembered me since he talked to my friend about me and called me \"an original\" (??) since i was applying for polisci and was interested in urban design. i looked him up before and a lot of ppl were complaining abt him online LMFAOOO we debated the healthcare system in Canada fervently. My only in-person interview so i liked the vibes more, but def an unfortunate experience!\n\nSciences Po & UC Berkeley - bro i kept saying falsehoods/misconceptions abt the dual degree, they grilled me on french world issues and i didn't have anything to say, i said i love protests and how destructive they are in France??? overall i felt so cooked after i reconnected w nature. the french person interviewing me looked at me with such contempt i still shake when i remember\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App (6/10): i still think it was too much narrative, not enough self-reflection! was abt the summer program i went to twice. talked about nostalgia and how ppl & places connect; but mostly, how i move on from past lives. i ramble at the end about the message. idk i don't rlly like it anymore\n\n**Supplementals**\n\nThe ones that stood out to me were:\n\nStanford -  I COOKED ON THESE!!! i loved the prompts. they rlly suited what i wanted to convey\n\nGeorgetown - cooked on these too. my why Georgetown/why major was so fucking fire i wish i got to submit it to other schools\n\nHarvard and Columbia - even tho these are my fav schools, these were fucking ass LMFOAOOO but the Columbia media list essay was fun. i categorized all my medias into categories like \"i love art&cities\" or \"i love politics\"\n\nSciences Po/UC Berkeley - my PIQs were mid but I wrote the dual degree essay in legit 30 minutes and it was half the wordcount.\n\n**Decisions, roughly ranked in order of my preference**\n\nWaitlists:\n\n>!Hamilton College !<\n\n>!(applied for the name haha founding father) !<\n\n>!i didn't write the supps so I'm not surprised!<\n\n>!waitlisted to nothing else !<\n\n>!i just wanted to build suspense lmao!<\n\nRejections:\u00a0\n\n>!Columbia University (i was so crestfallen over this. what about our NYC dreams?)!<\n\n>!Georgetown University (this one hurted kind of really really really bad)!<\n\n>!Harvard University (my real dream school i just kept quiet about) (my bsf got in.)!<\n\n>!University of Pennsylvania (this one had a lil kick to it)!<\n\n>!Yale University (several of my opps and my friend's opps got in)!<\n\n>!University of Chicago EA!<\n\n>!Princeton University!<\n\n>!Brown University !<\n\n>!Cornell University!<\n\n>!Stanford University !<\n\n>!Mass.

I\u2019ve known him for all four years of high school, taken 2 classes with him, gave him science fair guidance (for his son), and have continuously shared personal climate activism updates with him; he also coaches my Activity #2 (co-captain and senior officer)\u2192 Honor #1.\n\nIB English/AP Lit Teacher: 9/10, she and I would have heart-to-heart discussions (and sometimes rants about some ppl\u2026oops) regarding politics and literature. I loved connecting our texts in class, such as one by Toni Morrison, to systemic issues (unfortunately no one else really cared). We also share a wicked love for the outdoors and exploring uncharted places! The only reason I say 9/10 is because I got a 4 on the exam and had a decent amount of absences in her class, however, she fully understood my personal circumstances.\n\nSchool Library Specialist/Aide: 9/10, she is undoubtedly my school \u201cgrandma\" who I share all of my updates and personal adventures with. I sometimes help her sort books, organize equipment in the library, and tutor students from time to time. I read her rec and it said \u201c\\[my name\\] ranks among the most compassionate, driven, motivated, and dedicated volunteers I've encountered in my years at \\[my high school\\]\".\n\n**Interviews**\n\nHarvard: 10/10, it was amazing and I clicked immediately with my interviewer. It honestly felt like a casual conversation where I also detailed various projects/initiatives; it was nice hearing him talk abt different traditions and house pride at Harvard. The first question asked by him was \u201cdo you think we can save the world?\"\n\nYale: 8/10, I didn\u2019t prep much, but I loveddd talking with my interviewer about his experiences at Yale, my interests in science and government, and how multidisciplinary Yale is. He sent me the sweetest message after getting in, which honestly made my day.\n\n*\\*Note: Both interviewers were in their 60s/70s and my virtual interviews were requested by the alumni very last minute with a 1 to 2-day turnaround time.\\**\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement: 9/10, connecting personal growth with scientific exploration - an estuary near my house inspired me to conduct my ISEF project alongside other pursuits - tried to also keep it light-hearted\n\nSupplemental Essays: Harvard - 9/10 (honestly, I'm super proud of them :,)), Yale - 8/10, Stanford - 8/10 >!(wrote in 1 day..shhhhh)!<\n\nAdditional Information: 10/10, really helped highlight/reinforce parts of my application - mentioned semifinalist/finalist for programs like Coke Scholars and Senate Youth; elaborated on international recognition for work on the climate (e.g. travelling to DC for a funded event); discussed my burning love for languages (from a Chinese program to my Venezuelan friend helping me learn Spanish). In a *parallel universe*, I would undoubtedly major in linguistics and help indigenous language preservation efforts (sorry, ling is so fcking cool but bio/enviro currently has my heart).\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* >!Squidward Community College (SCC) - with a clarinet scholarship!!<\n* >!Vanderbilt (RD) - Chancellor\u2019s Scholarship!!<\n* >!FSU (RD) - Honors/Presidential Scholars!<\n* >!UF (RD) - Honors/Research Program!<\n* >!Yale (RD)!<\n* >!Stanford (RD)!<\n* >!Harvard (REA)!!!!<\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\n* >!Touching Grass State University (TGSU)!<\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n* >!N/A :,)!<\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nInitially, I wasn't going to make this post but a friend suggested I do so\u2014I feel like the past four years have been a wild ride\u2014filled with exhilaration, frenzy, stress, love, and growth (as an activist, student, researcher, and human being). There are a bunch of things that I would change, if I could go back, but\u2014as many people say\u2014EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT IN THE END. I have listed a few brief (p.s. you should study for your AP and IB exams...lol) pieces of advice:\n\n* **Do what genuinely interests you!** This is a clich\u00e9 statement, but it couldn't be closer to the truth. Want to make a language in your own script? Want to develop a CS model to identify plastic wastes? Want to pour your heart out into playing the guitar? Want to write a blog analyzing your favorite Laufey song? Want to create a mural in your community made with recycled materials?\n* **Please do not take a quadrillion classes indiscriminately.** I was obsessed with class rank in 10th and 11th grade, so I would naturally take online AP and DE classes on top of a full IB Diploma courseload. Uhhhh it was also crazy taking 4 sciences my senior year. Please. Do. Not. Do. This.\n* **Try not to compare your personal circumstances with others!** Everyone is on their own path coming from different socioeconomic backgrounds, medical histories, etc. Be the best YOU.\n* **Appreciate your teachers.** Yes, it's hard to reflect on your teachers when you have 6 others equally piling on assignments\u2014as you also try to balance ECs. However, they have helped shape who you are and are (for the most part...yes some just suck) really interesting individuals."

I also asked her for LOR for several summer programs and applied to and interned with her (school requirement for graduation) during my senior year. She's the teacher I'm closest to buuuuuttttt she can't really speak to my filmmaking, probably an 8\n\nFreshman/Junior English teacher \u2014 Again, very active participant. I excelled in writing essays for her classes, which is major relevant I would say. We're pretty close and she's known me for a while. Probably also an 8 lmao\n\nGuidance Counselor \u2014 Unless my GC is a bold faced liar lmao she's told me she has a very high opinion of me explicitly so I assume she wrote me a positive letter. I've spoken to her often about my filmmaking/artistic ambitions, she also wrote me LOR previously. We've also talked a lot about my school and rock band experiences, which are unique aspects of my application. I'm going to be bold and say this one is a 10\n\n**Interviews**\n\nPenn State Schreyers Honors College \u2014 This one was technically just \"a discussion with an alumni\" but my interviewer called it an interview during so lol illusion shattered. I felt that I seemed pretty nervous, I got to talk about a lot of important parts of my app but I tripped up pretty often. Interviewer told me I left a very positive impression on her.\n\nW&M/St. Andrews Joint Degree \u2014 I was a little awkward but this one went better. I was nervous because I knew one interviewer would be from Scotland and I didn't want to seem like an American airhead but it was fine. I was proud of how I did but I wasn't certain how the interviewers felt about me.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement \u2014 This one was about my experiences as a queer person.

I am simultaneously amazed at all my acceptances and furious about my rejections lol. I didn't expect to go to until about my Sophomore year of HS and I didn't dedicate my life to college apps, which was the right move. I only applied to places I really loved because I'd rather take a gap year and reapply then go somewhere I hated. I decided to apply for filmmaking last summer and had little help with my portfolio, so I am very very proud to have gotten into both SCA & Tisch."

Keep in mind I used to visit A2C in HS because I knew I was smart but my grades were not reflective because of the mental health crisises and not knowing how to study. In HS I was only accepted to one school, wrote a trauma/sob story essay, and had a 2.4 WEIGHTED GPA lol. I dropped out of college after THREE semesters, failed a semester of community college, and went back in 2023.\n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: Female\n* Race/Ethnicity: Black\n* Residence: VA\n* Income Bracket: $90kish, when I'm considered independent it's like <$15k lmao\n* Type of School: Public Title 1 High School > T300 Uni > Community College\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM, Legacy at one school but I don't think it mattered\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: English w/ concentration in Creative Writing, Minor in Black/Africana/African-American Studies. On a pre-law track and plan to go to law school/\n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA (UW/W): HS GPA: 2.4 W. University GPA: 1.24. CC GPA (with retakes): 3.89 (will go down after the Spring semester :/)\n* Rank (or percentile): None of my schools ranked\n* Number of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Honestly don't remember much of HS but I took a few Honors courses and a couple IB SL courses. Just finished an Honors class at my CC.\n* Senior Year Course Load: Had to be reduced or I wouldn't graduate because I did not show up to school or I was always tardy. Have about 60+ transferable college credits.\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\n\n* SAT (2017): 1160 (600RW, 550M) (I think?, this was my highest, first attempt was 1150 lmfao)\n* ACT (2017): 30 (34E, 27M, 34R, 24S) (Highest attempt, first attempt was 28)\n* AP/IB: Tbh I don't remember my IB test scores I think a 3 and 4?? Just remember getting credit for them at my first uni but not my community college lmao\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities** *(Currently)*\n\n1. Retail job for 4 years\n2. Food service job for 6 months that was done concurrently with my retail job\n3. Freelance makeup artist, did paid makeup occasionally on others\n4. Caretaker for mother who was in the hospital from late 2023 to present\n5. Volunteered at an elementary school library for a month\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. Dean's List for 3 semesters (Idk if I'll get Dean's list this semester)\n2. Phi Theta Kappa\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\n1. LOR from English 1 prof - had a great presentation and she was always very supportive of me. Didn't read it but I hope it was glowing.\n2. LOR from English 2 prof - she was a great professor with an amazing personality and I think she enjoyed my essays. She understood some of my struggles. Didn't read it.\n3. LOR from Science prof - took both sections of a class with him and hoped it'd be glowing since I explained Science was not my background. I got to read it because I was going to use it for an internship. Was generic.\n4. LOR from my retail manager - who I've grown close to and known all these four years. Consider her like a mom/older sister to me. It made me cry because she explained how much I've matured and grown.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nMount Holyoke - 9/10: I rambled sometimes and had to ask what the question was for a couple questions. Answered a question and she told me that as many times as she's done an interview like this she's never heard my answer before (was a good thing).\n\nSmith - 8/10: Mentioned my desire for community service and she got me in touch with the community service center (Jandon).\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nI thought I did well on my essays. I tried to explain how I initially wanted to be an author/screenwriter but changed my path to pre-law while still being an English major because I want to help disadvantaged backgrounds who are effected by sex trafficking. Mentioned Law & Order: SVU. Also, discussed my desire to join/create community service initiatives and join whichever Black affinity group was on campus. I also gave a timeline of my post high school career to explain my gaps in education and low grades.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* >!George Mason + Honors College (legacy)!<\n* >!Hollins ($25k merit scholarship)!<\n* >!Mount Holyoke (rejected in HS)!<\n* >!University of Virginia!<\n* >!William & Mary (rejected in HS)!<\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* >!Smith (Ada Comstock Scholar) - was pleasantly surprised but ultimately did not accept the waitlist. (rejected in HS)!<\n* >!Wellesley (Davis Degree) - one of my top schools and I was shocked. At first I thought I was rejected but then I read on. Definitely accepting the waitlist and hoping to write the best LOCI possible! [accepted off the waitlist! didn't even write a LOCI] COMMITTED!<\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* >!Amherst (rejected in HS)!<\n* >!Bates (rejected in HS)!<\n* >!University of Richmond!<\n* >!Wesleyan!<\n* >!Williams (rejected in HS)!<\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI still have 4 schools left (Barnard, Brown, Howard, and Vassar). I'm not holding my breath for them because Barnard, Brown, and Vassar are need-aware while I do not plan to go to Howard because I would commute and they did not have the courses I wanted.\n\nHowever, this goes to show you can fuck up high school and some of college and still come back! A lot happened in my gap years incl. a couple of \\[redacted\\] attempts. I'm still amazed with how far I've come as I was the kid in high school who would never show up or show up halfway through the day. It got so bad for me senior year that they told me I could have my schedule reduced or go to the alternative high school. I reduced my schedule but even then I BARELY graduated high school due to one class I almost failed (I think I got a 65 or 66). My first uni wasn't any better and was a terrible experience for me. I am so grateful to have worked at my retail job and met an amazing group of women who believed in me no matter what. I've been able to grow and mature as a person tremendously.\n\nI don't know where I'll commit but I have 10 days to decide. ;\\_; It's between UVA and Mount Holyoke but it's a super hard decision for me as I've always wanted to go to an LAC in New England but because of personal reasons I may stay in VA. I'll update later.\n\nETA: Committed to Wellesley off the waitlist!"

nothing was asked about my application itself, questions were more focused about the type of student id be (ex: how would you take advantage of a liberal arts education, favourite teachers, etc). definitely did well on these questions but i was also a little nervous since going into it ik i was borderline, but i was pretty sure i nailed it\n* mit: virtual -

the cost of procrastination is real, and it was also the reason i never finished my stanford application. i still loved the school but i was bogged down with harvey mudd (due the same day) and ended up running out of time to write meaningful essays for stanford\n\nfeel free to pm with questions, but im on the road and may take a while to respond"

        "post": "Hi I have about 24 hours left. Would love any opinions/insights!  \n\n\nInterests: Economics at Stanford, Commerce at UVA, to find the intersection of business and policy to solve social issues. I\u2019m very interested in social entrepreneurship or just exploring how to make impacts w/ business in general. I have a broad range of interests and I am not 100% on what my future profession will be.  \n\n\nCost: I\u2019m in a very blessed position where my family can pay for Stanford, but then if I go to grad school (MBA or law) then that\u2019s on my own. If Jefferson, that money can be saved for grad school.  \n\n\nI\u2019ve went down the Reddit rabbit hole and the opinions are very split, so here are my pros and cons \u2014  \n\n\n**Stanford:**  \n*Pros*:  \n- I just came back from the Stanford admit weekend and it was incredible. Genuinely loved it so much.  \n- Amazing weather and location (Silicon Valley)  \n- Wide reach of opportunities and connections  \n- World-class professors  \n- Can explore top education and top programs within different interests (ethics/philosophy, STEM, policy, CS, etc)  \n- Yummy yummy food  \n- Just from this last week I can tell I would be surrounded by insanely spectacular yet kind students  \n- A lot more cultural diversity than I\u2019m used to, I enjoyed being in California  \n- Dream School  \n\n\n*Cons:*  \n- Very far, but I love new experiences so it\u2019s not too big of a deal  \n- Cost (can pay, but still a bit of a burden. People keep on saying that the money comes back w/ Stanford name but idk)  \n- More competition for clubs/student orgs  \n- Most opportunities seem to come from being in those top student clubs  \n- Quarter system/pacing (I\u2019m sure I can adjust but I would greatly appreciate thoughts on the rigor of classes, especially in Econ)  \n\n\n**UVA Jefferson:**  \n*Pros:*  \n- Full ride (including fully paid travel abroad/study, professional development fund)  \n- Close-knit community of scholars and w/ the foundation  \n- SUPER amazing and consistent support, resources, and opportunities from the program (I can already tell how attentive their organization is)  \n- Would have money for grad school  \n- A little closer to home  \n- Better sports scene (kinda)  \n- Very supportive yet motivated/driven student culture, I reaaally loved UVA when I went to visit too  \n- I\u2019m not looking for a cutthroat environment, and UVA seems like a solid balance  \n- Told to have more freedom to explore interests because of the support from the scholarship  \n- East Coast opportunities (DC, NYC, Boston, etc.)  \n- Dream Scholarship  \n\n\n*Cons:*  \n- Location (Charlottesville, but being kinda close to DC is cool, ab 2 hours)  \n- Less start-up culture  \n- Food isn\u2019t as good lol  \n- Less diversity?  \n- Less West Coast/worldwide presence w/ name \u201cprestige\u201d compared to Stanford/Ivies (this may be naive, but it is something to consider if I end up going into consulting, VCs, etc)  \n\n\nIn full honesty, I haven\u2019t heard anyone tell me a bad thing about Stanford or UVA, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be super happy at either place! I\u2019m split very 50/50 right now between both, and I would appreciate any thoughts!"

IELTS, TOEFL, etc.):\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities:** (slightly vague so i don\u2019t get doxxed cause i\u2019m easily findable)\n\n1. personal business of braiding hair since 9th grade, made revenue of $10,000+ and have an instagram account with 5000 followers account that i linked \n\n2. chapter president for (insert national org here)\u2014very involved in this and i created in person workshops to educate the youth on african american culture in our community. i also led various fundraisers including a community thanksgiving fundraiser. we collected over 3000+ canned goods and gave them in person to economically disadvantaged communities (featured on the local news for these and linked news article in additional info section of common app).\n\n3. intern for local sickle cell anemia org, we planned the first awareness campaign through hosting a fashion show (i created this idea lmao). we raised over $5000 in one night and we were able to get the national sickle cell director to help us award sickle cell victims. this was super fun and we were once again put on a news article.\n\n4. bed builder for an organization. once every month we build beds and then deliver them to families in their homes, i\u2019ve built and delivered around 60+ beds. been doing this since sophomore year.\n\n5. independent tutor at my school, taught 9 kids ranging from middle school to high school. nothing too important here\n\n6. volunteered at local neurosurgeon clinic. i was able to observe super cool surgeries and volunteered for around like 15 hours total. would 100% do again!\n\n7. student council vice president. nothing too big here but i advocated for the student body and got a couple of things changed in the handbook, my principal said that she was able to mention this in her LOR.\n\n8. varsity tennis all 4 years, captain of my team. i\u2019ve won over 25+ tournaments in my bracket (boys A doubles), competed in district all for years (got 3rd in my bracket junior year and senior year), and competed in state for sophomore, junior, and senior year (don\u2019t ask how that went). ANYWHOO it was fun and i had a lot of great memories ! oh also i mentioned that i was the first african american player on the team lmao \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d, life was rough out here .\n\n9.  rotary interact club president. hosted 5 blood drives with a local blood center (honestly only like 10 people donated blood in total). i also partnered with the bed building org that i mentioned to raise funds for them and we raised around $500!! this was a super chill and laid back club\n\n10. none\n\n**Awards/Honors:**\n\n1. got a leadership award due to service in my community (can\u2019t name the specific award obv or i\u2019m doxxed) but it was because of the thanksgiving fundraiser. the mayor awarded it to me :OOOO\n\n2. RYLA camp award (only the interact clubbers know this one)\n\n3. college board african american recognition program (super confused how i got this because i thought you had to take 3 ap exams or more to qualify but wtv)\n\n4. national honor society secretary & national thespian society honor thespian\n\n5. academic champion x4 yrs (i was desperate) \n\n**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** uhh honestly i hated my personal statement and didn\u2019t let anyone read it except a stupid AI that scores it (please don\u2019t do this). but basically for my personal statement i talked about how i hated hearing my dad hum traditional igbo hymns (all my igbos rise up) initially, and then i reconciled with that and ended up developing a love for my african heritage, leading me to create a hair braiding business specifically geared to braid african hairstyles. it sounds boring but i think i wrote it very well and mentioned my difficulties being a first generation american, got emotional at the end. obv colleges liked it!!\n\nmy supplementals talked about various ECs and i was silly in a lot of them (humor is key in your essays, but don\u2019t be cringe!!) i think my favorite supplemental essay topic was how i was told frewuently by my grandmother that i shouldn\u2019t act \u2018black\u2019 and how through the workshops mentioned in EC #1 i worked to break that stigma of how we\u2014as african americans\u2014are told to repress our identity. through the workshops i was able to show the african american youth the beauty of black culture. (it sounds sloppy here cause im writing this at 1 am but i promise it was good)\n\nmy why major was around interning with a sickle cell anemia nonprofit. i mentioned how while my time advocating for research and spreading awareness acts a foundational way to support a cause, actions speak louder than words. i mentioned how i wanted to be able to be on the front lines of sickle cell anemia research and help my community through the university\u2019s research programs and opportunities.\n\ni had 4 LORs. one from my principal, ap bio + ap chem teacher, ap lang + ap lit teacher, and one from the mayor of my city ( :OOO ). most schools only let me put 2 so i mainly used my science and english teacher. the optional LOR i used was the mayor\u2019s LOR (she showed me the LOR and yall she was actually gassing me up i actually cried she\u2019s so sweet and i had so much fun working with her in a lot of my orgs)\n\nreceived interview from duke harvard yale princeton, upenn, and stanford. they all went amazing imo\n\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n* *Acceptances:* UT Austin (early), duke, upenn (CAS)\n* *Waitlists:* princeton, stanford \n* *Rejections:* harvard, yale\n\n**Additional Information:** \n\nthis was a crazy ride and i wouldn\u2019t do it again. honestly i did not have a proper college list going into this so my only safety was UT (i was auto admission and didn\u2019t care about being put in a liberal arts major). i should\u2019ve applied to more colleges, especially ones that have full rides. also going test optional definitely hurt my chances for harvard and yale. but i\u2019m so grateful for my acceptances and it\u2019s literally a miracle. i recently committed to duke and im so happy to be a blue devil! i\u2019m still on the waitlist for princeton and stanny.\n\n\ni wasn\u2019t rlly a perfect applicant. i had a C on my transcript in junior year (but ngl that was my grade below an A). i also got suspended sophomore year for being in a fight (self defense but that\u2019s how it goes ig). \n\nmy advice to any juniors out there is just do what u love. i never had any research done or had super cracked ECs and i was still able to get into really good schools. my upenn AO emailed me and said how she cried because of my common app essay and really helped her understand me as an applicant, so make sure you use your essays as a way to be vulnerable. good luck to everyone, keep trusting God!"

I really value internships and a good job post-grad, as I don't want to do grad school at the moment, and UT definitely provides me all those opportunities. However, I am also a liberal arts girly and I would really love to take Columbia's core curriculum. The downside is taking the core pretty much means that I won't have a proper internship until junior year at the very earliest. "

I just want this to be a PSA that there is free help out there, and it's very likely that it's better if not near the help you can get from the money pit that is college admissions counseling.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want any advice/help from my experience!"

I made a more specific post with my stats and stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ccbqwg/socal_stem_girl_throws_her_hat_into_the_ring/)\n\nFor context, I got into both schools for their Neuroscience major, but I may switch to psychobiology or immunology. I plan to go to med school/graduate school (for public health). I live in the LA area and while I always wanted to be oos for college, the distance from my house to UCLA is fine by me. If I were to be OOS I wanted that New England vibe but I've ruled out the schools I got into in that area... Emory is on my list because it did come out cheaper in tuition and some of my friends are urging me to go. Also I got into Emory's Atlanta campus\n\nBoth schools end up totaling to around the same cost, with UCLA being \\~8k, and Emory \\~3k + 4k health insurance, + money being spent on plane rides, new clothes, etc. etc.\n\nThe most important factors to me are the relationships I want to develop with professors, as well as  having a good GPA+MCAT score. I want to be able to handle coursework rigor and be involved with research but also be able to join clubs and have time for things socially. :'0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UCLA pros:**\n\n**-** t15, more prestige \\^\\^'', and #1 dining hall!!\n\n\\- rly exciting environment (lot of events and things to do)\n\n\\-  i have connections to researchers + professors there who have said they're willing to mentor me/take me under their wing with labs and stuff\n\n\\- close to home\n\n\\- I have friends who go here/are going to go here\n\n\\- Good school spirit!! I want to join the marching band\n\n\\- would take my 3s on my AP tests (i only took 2 APs, 3s on both... lol.....)\n\n**UCLA cons:**\n\n\\- *close to home* (not a huge con bc i think ill miss my younger sister a lot)\n\n\\- scared to have to take an extra quarter(s) if I don't get all the classes I need\n\n\\- harder to get opportunities?\n\n\\- much bigger, crowded, competitive environment, esp with so many people\n\n\\- idk how to feel abt greek life.. or that undie run\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Emory pros:**\n\n\\- OOS (i do thrive in airports)\n\n\\- Smaller, can form more connections with teachers\n\n\\- Cheaper based on CoA alone\n\n\\- Well known for their health science, ranked higher for immunology but not neuro\n\n\\- according to my counselor, ill have a \"more transformative experience\" if i travel for college\n\n**Emory cons:**\n\n\\- I've never been to Georgia, hard to get a read on the vibe and environment\n\n\\- $$$ for flights and new clothes\n\n\\- I am just not as excited to go there as I am with UCLA, BUT it might be better for my future and so I'm willing (?) to sacrifice that aspect\n\n\\- I'm a poc and low income, and I've been told there's going to be a huge socioeconomic status disparity...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n..I think UCLA sounds like a better experience to me, but Emory could provide better opportunities for my future and career sooo I'm really not sure sorry for the long post :\\["

I wrote about the stories I heard and encountered while taking care of the elderly and how I've begun making my own stories. I kept it as genuine as possible. My Yale AO said this made her tear up and I think it was a pretty sentimental piece. Initially, I was comparing my essay to those of people online and I was so worried because mine didn't look like theirs and I didn't start ec dropping and shit like them but honestly I had nothing to worry about.\u00a0**Rating maybe: 9 (or 9.5?) / 10**\n\nSupplementals\n\nMy supps were def rushed but I would say these were really good as well. I kept them genuine and did my best to convey as many aspects of my character as possible. Compassion and diversity was a big theme for me loll.\u00a0**Rating maybe: 8.5/10**\n\nLORs\n\nI didn't see most of my LORs but I assume they were good. My calc teacher wrote how I was the best student he's had in years and my lang teacher talked about some classroom moments (forgot what exactly).\u00a0**Rating maybe: 7 - 9 (crazy range ik) / 10**\n\n**Interviews**\n\nTufts (9.5/10): Very chill and she calmed my nerves a LOT. It was like talking to another kid my age. Lasted like 40 minutes?\n\nHarvard (8/10): Almost very chill, was at starbucks. I messed up and stuttered a few times but overall this was very good. Lasted like 70 mins\n\nYale (10/10): My interviewer and I were both Black and were able to connect really well because of that. We talked a lot about the Yale environment and being a person of color on campus. Lasted like 80 mins\n\nPrinceton (9/10): One of my shorter interviews but he was sooo chill. He was a busy guy so our interview only lasted 20 mins but I was able to express myself pretty confidently and tell him why I liked Princeton.\n\nDuke (6/10): Ok my interviewer was lowk a bot bruh and the interview was p awkward. I didn't do enough research so when he asked me why Duke, I gave a vague answer and bro told me \"Well other schools have that too, what makes Duke different.\"\n\nURichmond Scholars (9.5/10): Even though it was in front of like 8 other people it was very chill. I was able to confidently talk about myself and what I'd like to do at Richmond\n\n**DECISIONS**\n\n***Rejections:***\n\n>!University of Miami (EA)!<\n\n>!Brandeis University!<\n\n>!New York University!<\n\n>!Boston University!<\n\n***Waitlists***\n\n>!Washington University in St. Louis!<\n\n***Acceptances***\n\n>!Duke University!<\n\n>!Yale University (likely letter)!<\n\n>!Northeastern University (EA)!<\n\n>!University of Massachusetts Amherst (EA)!<\n\n>!University of Massachusetts Boston (EA)!<\n\n>!Northwestern University!<\n\n>!Johns Hopkins University!<\n\n>!Tulane University (Deferred EA > Accepted RD)!<\n\n>!Emory University!<\n\n>!Tufts University!<\n\n>!University of Richmond + Richmond Scholars full-ride (EA)!<\n\n>!Harvard College (likely letter)!<\n\n>!Cornell University!<\n\n>!Princeton University!<\n\n>!Case Western Reserve University (Deferred EA > Accepted RD)!<\n\n  \n**Thoughts + What I Think Helped Me Stand Out**\n\nSo, yall can probably look at my grades/ecs and realize that I'm not the most cracked applicant (I only took 4 APs!!!). My stats and ecs were definitely really good! but dawg I couldn't even place in my regional science fair. So many kids were better than me in terms of grades and ecs.\n\nBut, at the same time, I think in comparison to my school I really stood out with my SAT and grades. BUT ALSO, at the same time it wasn't just stats. My stats just put me into consideration. I genuinely think it was my ECs and essays that got me in. The way I framed my application around compassion and shit I was genuinely passionate about I think really shined through to my AOs and they liked that. I didn't lie about anything (except I might've miscalculated or rounded up some hours...). I wrote my essays just as I would during English class or irl. I didn't try to be someone I wasn't and genuinely did ecs I liked. (and I think yall should do the same!!!).\n\nThe college admissions process is draining. To those hs juniors or below looking at this. Start early. Take the SAT and do your best on it. In my honest opinion, DONT HAVE A DREAM SCHOOL. Fall in love with a good safety school. Write naturally and don't try to use big words to sound smart (it becomes unbearable trust me). And tbh just try your best. Yall got this :)"

This will be my first time in the USA/canada/UK.\n\nI've dreamt about Computer Science since 14, and have been incredibly passionate about it for years, having started playing around with it since I was about 8 or 9 years old.\n\nMy sort of career goals revolve around working at a FAANG company (facebook, amazon, google etc), preferably in SF/Silicon valley/the bay area, and so I want to go to a university best equipped to help me meet these goals. So its kind of like a Californian dream haha. Obviously, things like social life (doesn't have to to do with partying etc necessarily either) matter to me, along with table tennis and volleyball culture/availability.\n\nThese are the Unis I got into (USA, Canada, UK):\n\nBoston University\n\nUC Irvine\n\nUC San Diego (Undeclared, no CS)\n\nUC Davis (\\~17% scholarship)\n\nUC Santa Cruz (<20% scholarship)\n\nSan Jose State University\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nDurham University\n\nUniversity of Bristol (Data Science, no CS)\n\nI am currently heavily leaning towards UC Irvine, however, UofTs acceptance has made me think of it as well. UC Irvine seems well equipped for jobs/ops in CS etc while also having a good and safe day-to-day life while also being next door to LA, which obviously opens doors to an extreme amount of opportunities, its kind of like having the best of both worlds if that makes sense? I guess i just need reassurance about UC irvine. Also yeah, I'm basically not considering UK anymore, its more abt us v can.\n\nIf other parts of my profile, like activities etc, would help with this then please let me know and I will share.\n\n"

I filtered the essay through the lens of me being sure for awhile but not mentioning it due to the huge acrimony in my family and not wanting to add more drama, and my anxiety on how it could cause problems within the various sports teams I was on. I ended with my surprise and gratitude at how accepting everyone was of it. Lessons learned: value of being yourself, value of being accepting of oneself, value of asking for help and support, a great reaffirmation in the kindness of people, etc\n\nI also tried to subtly highlight how much time all of these sports took up as a backdoor reason for why my GPA is good, but not great.\n\n**Two asides: my family situation and sports stuff**\n\nFamily, as it relates to finances: So, getting super personal here -- my parents are currently going through a super contested divorce. Long story short, they've hated each other as long as I can remember and quite obviously tried to hold on until the youngest (me) was on a good path. My Mom was injured at her job before I was born -- oh, btw, I'm also adopted, I've got a lot going on here -- and her sole income is from disability and from a legal settlement forever ago, structured as an annuity. Because of the divorce, my Dad is shielding income and obfuscating the numbers and it's basically really difficult and unclear to schools what our real financial situation is and how much my family is able to pay.\n\nSports stuff -- I'm not getting any full-ride scholarships at the D1 level, but I'm good enough to receive inbound interest from coaches, be a priority walk-on most places and get a leg up in admission. Hard to quantify what that advantage is; I'd characterize it as a coach at each of these schools putting in good words on my behalf. If it's not clear, my sport in college will be >!track and field!<.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nMom's alma mater and local safety school, which feels disrespectful because it's actually really good >!Pitt RD!<\n\nLocalish safety school that TBH I had zero interest in attending for sports rivalry reasons >!Penn State RD!<\n\nDad's alma mater and dream school...or is it? >!Carnegie Mellon RD!<\n\nA new challenger approaches! >!Stanford RD!<\n\nHmm, not the best CS department but got great vibes from their coach/team on a visit >!Duke RD!<\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n>!Princeton RD!<\n\n>!UPenn RD!<\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n>!Harvard RD!<\n\n>!Yale RD!<\n\n>!MIT RD!<\n\n>!UC-Berkeley RD!<\n\n**Yeah, yeah, where you going?**\n\n>!---> Stanford! <---!<\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI'm incredibly blessed -- I thought my GPA would disqualify me. I do think, for what it's worth, that all of the sports and ECs *are* a legitimate explanation but given some of the profiles that get turned down at some of these places, I felt like it was an uphill battle despite my SAT score. Ultimately my decision came down to whether or not I'd go to what was my dream school forever and a campus I'd already been on countless times or try to forge a new path for myself.\n\nHonestly, I think all of the bullshit with my family pushed me to get the hell out of the state and go do my thing. (Financially, Stanford and CMU ended up about equal once various grants, scholarship, and aid got factored in.) It's going to be hard leaving my Mom given her health but for so many reasons it's the right choice and frankly, I think she knows it's best for me on a personal level as well. I get to compete for a world-class team, I get to prepare for my career in the absolute center of the technology world, and, to be blunt, I get to experience my identity in a place a little more culturally open than suburban Pennsylvania.\n\nThat was a lot -- thanks for reading!"

I thought that it would be the ultimate display of intelligence and grit to be accepted to one of these schools. However, I eventually realized that dropping 350 bands on a private university wasn't feasible. Any underclassmen lurking on this page should reconsider meatriding colleges with fake 501(c)(3)s and instead try to do something meaningful. Focus on improving yourself and admission officers will appreciate your efforts as an added benefit. If not, you at least gained something in the process. I realized this later than I would've liked, but earlier than many people."

        "post": "Lots of people turn Harvard down. A friend, recently retired, worked as the Director of College Counseling at a highly respected independent school.  He said that over the years, he saw many students turn Harvard down for compelling/understandable reasons.\n\nThose reasons included:\n\n\\*Feeling underwhelmed during 'Veritas,' the days Harvard offers for accepted students, while clearly \"experiencing 'the magic,' elsewhere.\"\n\n\\*Getting full-rides elsewhere, including merit money, hard to turn down when the student envisions going to grad school, including med school, that will cost a lot of money.  \n\n\\*Athletic Recruits.  Better athletics teams, training facilities, and opportunities to grow and compete as an athlete, elsewhere.\n\n\\*Choosing Yale over Harvard for humanities, campus life, residential life, collegiality, and ambiance.\n\n\\*Choosing Princeton over Harvard for Math and/or Physics.\n\n\\*Choosing MIT over Harvard for Engineering.\n\n\\*Choosing Stanford over Harvard for the weather, over-all campus feel, and/or being in the land of start ups and entrepreneurial ventures.\n\n\\*Choosing Columbia over Harvard for the incomparable experience of attending college in NYC, and/or, in the case of those with roots in NYC, attending college near home, especially when family circumstances make it a command performance to do so.\n\n\\*Selecting a college like CMU over Harvard for their world class Computer Science Program.\n\n\\*Specific, specialized fields of study either not offered at Harvard, or, not deemed among the best in their field at Harvard.\n\n\\*Finding the courage to go elsewhere, when Harvard isn't deemed the best/right fit, for a multitude of reasons, while withstanding the pressure from family, peers, even themselves, to turn a place like Harvard down...when it's not the right option.\n\nMe, personally, I attended Columbia's School of General Studies, loved attending class in the morning, working late afternoons and evenings, living off campus, and enjoying all NYC had to offer.  I didn't apply to Harvard, and have no regrets about my undergrad years at Columbia.  Bottom line, my friend, and former 40 year college placement director shared that \"finding the right college is all about fit.  And, sometimes, Harvard, like any other college, simply isn't the right fit.  And that's perfectly OK.\"\n\nIn any case, I found our conversation and his perspective fascinating, as it was given toward helping students make the best possible decision for their college years, and beyond.  And, that advice often included finding the courage to turn a place like Harvard down, because it just wasn't the right fit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"

My school also only lets people take AP classes in their junior year but my parents did not want me to be too stressed out and forced me to take none (very unusual I know) which I think made my application less strong to the top schools I wanted to get into. However, it did make my junior year wayyy less stressful so I guess I cannot complain too much. My ECs are also underwhelming because I literally played baseball 6-7 days a week from freshman year-end of last summer. I don\u2019t regret it at all but it certainly limited me in that respect.\n\n\n"

Gold President's Volunteer Service Award for 310 Hours of Volunteer Service at JKL (National, 12)\n2. 2nd Place at XXX Hackathon for Creating AI-Powered \u201cAkinator\u201d for Travel Destination Ideas (International, 11)\n3. Excellence in AP Calc BC Award for being Top Student w/ Highest AP Calc BC Grade out of 140 Students (School, 11)\n4. AP Scholar with Distinction (National, 12)\n5. National Merit Commended Student (National, 12)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n* Counselor & 10th grade bio teacher: Probably pretty average. I had to fill out a questionnaire for both so I had input on what info I wanted them to include but I was never a standout student or anything bc I\u2019m an introvert lol\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Common App: I wrote about my distant relationship with my dad and how I fixed it by connecting with him through shared interests (food lol) & consciously making an effort to open up to him / becoming a more open/candid/vulnerable person in general. I came up with this essay topic after extensive brainstorming in the summer but I was hesitant to write it bc I still have very complicated feelings about my dad/our relationship, but hey college essays are all about self reflection and all that. I ended up actually writing the essay in mid Sept in 1 week bc I needed to submit a Common App essay for a school assignment. I then revised it for 2-3 weeks afterwards and my English teacher reviewed it and she said it was really solid.\n\n**Decisions (all EA)**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* University of Pittsburgh\n* Penn State\n* NJIT with 3k/yr merit scholarship\n* Virginia Tech\n* Rutgers New Brunswick SAS (B.S. CS) & SOE (Electrical and Computer Engineering)\n* UMD with invitation to Carillon Communities LLP\n* Northeastern Honors with 27k/yr honors scholarship (Boston campus)\n* Purdue\n* UIUC - COMMITTED!!!! \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\n\nWaitlists:\n\n* Georgia Tech (EA deferred) - Declined waitlist spot\n\nRejections:\n\n* NONE!!!\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* I was planning to shotgun and apply to a ton of schools (all EA) but I procrastinated and didn't start my supps until late September lol. The time constraint really helped me narrow down my choices bc I HATE writing supps and if I thought the prompt was too time consuming or annoying I would just move the school to RD and eventually I just didn't apply. This made me realize that I wasn't actually interested in attending any of those schools even though they were good for CS; I was just trying to shotgun prestigious schools bc that's what everyone with successful results seemed to do. I embraced the \"go big or go home\" mindset and I encourage other people to do so too (esp if you hate writing supps)! I concentrated on writing solid supps for the 4 schools that I actually wanted to attend, and I accepted that I\u2019d go to Rutgers if I didn't get into my top choices."

The first (school A) is private school, and has significantly more academic merit. I know if I go to school A, then I will most likely come out with a pretty good job. The campus is not quite the best(inner city school so the campus is spread out, confusing, and there's a possibility I would have to dorm with up to 7 other people in small dorms) and tuition is EXPENSIVE. I happen to be middle class and even with getting into the honors program, getting multiple scholarships, and a decent amount of financial aid I would still have to pay 23,000 a year(2,300 a month with the 10-month payment plan). I could get a job or even two, but that is definitely a financial strain( and a mental one). Obviously there are some advantages to school A like renowned teachers and amazing internships opportunities, I just don't know if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nSchool B is a state school, I originally applied there because I knew I would get in and I needed safety, plus my friend who's a grade below has some interest in the school, which means there would be a possibility of going to the same school as them. Like I said the school doesn't have a lot of academic merit, but the dorms are spacious (and I would only have to have one to two roommates), they have a awesome theater (which I'm not majoring in but I've always had an interest and who like to join the technical crew), and the location is really cool/ has a lot of charm. Lastly, school B is WAY less expensive. Roughly 12,000 a year. Though, of course this school doesn't have as many resources as School A, and has less internship opportunities, so I'm generally not sure I can get a decent job after college.\n\nEver since I was young I was pressured into thinking I need to go to the top universities in order to get a good job, and have a good life. I worked VERY hard in high school for it. Now that I'm contemplating a state school I feel like I've wasted all those times where I overexerted myself to achieve. Also, can I even get a good(well-paying) job if I go to a state school? Or is that just the \"I need to be the best student ever\" brainwashing? I'm sorry if this is long but I am very confused, and somehow feel ashamed and guilty that I want to relax and have a chill college experience(where I won't be in debt) vs private school life I thought I was going to have. Also, sorry this is so long \ud83d\ude2d"

end of these four years of straight ass, the only feeling i feel isnt some immense feeling of accomplishment, its just fear and regret tbh. doing all of this has allowed me to meet some of the most interesting, motivated people i'll probably ever meet and to have the most incredible experiences of my life, but a lot of it really is just a straight grind. i really just regret how much i focused my high school time on just building a resume rather than just doing stuff i thought was really interesting and just going hard in the paint in that shit, because now, as a senior on the verge of graduation, i realize that kanye basically said it best in good morning: \"look at the valedictorians scared of the future.\" i've spent so much time focused on just looking good for college that now that I'm actually headed off, I realize that I'm almost mentally unable to live in the present moment rather than looking countless years into the future and that I'm absolutely terrified about the immense amount of changes my life is about to go through.\n\ni think my best piece of advice for anyone younger, really, is to stay away from forums like this. only use the wiki of a2c, avoid this sub in particular, and just block collegeconfidential from your router lmao. the reason why the college admissions process is so awful is that its become so gamey, when in reality, the more naturally you take the process, the higher likelihood that you will just naturally end up where you are probably best suited for. if you grind out just trying to make it to a top uni, you'll just feel miserable while you're there because you've spent so much time being someone you arent, and this college will admit you on the basis that this person that you arent is a good match for them, so you'll find actually fitting in pretty difficult. just think of it like this: take college applications seriously, but understand that you don't simply live to write things down and brag about them. rather, live for the sake of having amazing memories, as that authenticity is the secret sauce that makes the amazing essays that people are constantly wishing for. additionally, remember that this whole process isnt meritocratic based on any easily measurable characteristics like gpa or extracurriculars. its based on trying to determine how much you as a whole person fit the school's interests."

I am instate for the UCs and leaning towards UCR due to the proximity to home and the ability to also take business classes. However, I have been hearing good things about UW and UCSC in terms of their location and job opportunities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 1: UCSC (CS)\n\nOption 2: UCR (CS with Business Application)\n\nOption 3: UW Seattle (Pre-Science)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe costs with UCR and UCSC should both be around 11k per year. But for UW I would be paying the OOS tuition of somewhere near 60k per year and risk not getting into their CS-related majors. I have been to all three campuses and like them all, so I would appreciate any insights. Thank you in advance!"

I wrote about my experiences teaching kids art (how trying to make art exciting for them helped me become more fluid in my own artistic practice), being a CS peer tutor (how teaching and troubleshooting reignited my childhood passion for programming), doing figure drawing for the first time at CSSSA (learning to value progress over perfection), and wearing lolita fashion (specifically how I express my creativity through alternative fashion and how I reconcile my transgender identity with a style that's so overtly feminine). Nothing extraordinary, but I've been told I have a compelling enough writing style, so there's that.\n\nCommon App Essay: I took the riskier route and tried to tackle the \"dead grandpa\" essay. His passing was recent for me when I wrote the essay, it had happened earlier that year. It was less about his death and more a reflection on the way my family/my family's origins/my culture had always created a sense of heavy academic pressure, and how his passing made me realize that I could honor their expectations and hopes for me while still being my own person. I wrote the essay in a more meandering style, so it's hard to summarize, but I think it was alright. It was more about me as a person than me as a student, since I covered more of the academic/art related stuff in my other supplementals.  \nPortfolio  \nHonestly, not... ideal. My portfolio was good, but a lot less realism/fully developed technical skill. I think I had some good figure drawing stuff in there, but I could've used some more still life. I don't have a ton of formal art education when it comes to the technical stuff, so I think I'm a little lacking there.   \nDecisions  \nAccepted:  \n(Still figuring out financial aid stuff, so no cost info, sorry about that)  \nCornell (Art)\n\nParsons (Illustration)\n\nPratt (Illustration)\n\nVirginia Tech (Creative Technologies)\n\nBoston University (Graphic Design)\n\nUniversity of San Fransisco (Art)\n\nUniversity of Oregon (Art)\n\nChapman University (Graphic Design)\n\nUC Irvine (Art)\n\nUC Santa Cruz (Art)\n\nUC Merced (Art)\n\nUC Riverside (Art)\n\nCal Poly SLO (Art w/ Emphasis in Graphic Design)\n\nCal Poly Pomona (Graphic Design)\n\nCSU Long Beach (Graphic Design)\n\nSan Diego State (Graphic Design)\n\nSan Jose State (Animation & Illustration)\n\n  \nRejected:  \nUC Los Angeles (Design & Media Arts)  \nUC Berkeley (Architecture, not sure what I was thinking with this??)\n\nUC Davis (Design)\n\nUT Austin (Design)\n\nUMich (Art)  \nRISD\n\nCarnegie Mellon (Design)  \nWaitlist:  \nUC San Diego (Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts)  \nUC Santa Barbara (Art)\n\nHonestly?

EDIT: room and board for the first year is around 12k USD due to how expensive the dorms are the first year, but that number quickly falls to around 8k once i get my own apartment --> total cost is 15.5k for first year and 8.5k USD all other years\n   2. arguably the most prestigious university in canada with an insane medical school and AI/machine learning research --> wet dream for computational structural biology lowkey\n   3. professional engineering designation, a ton of design and research courses, and no GEs!\n   4. miniscule medical focus and not pre-med friendly, which means i don't have to breathe the same air as premed pests!!\n   5. downtown in a major city with an amazing public transit system!! i will lose my mind if i have to depend on cars for another 4 years\n   6. really bad winters, interesting linguistic war, and extremely far from any friends/family except my grandparents\n   7. the program takes 5 years to complete which is so long for an undergrad\n      1. for god sakes it literally is entirely master's level classes the last two years i have no idea how am i going to do this\n   8. program is really small and new, so it will be a lot easier to get to know my professors for LORs :)\n   9. will pay me like 20k to get my master's too\n   10. fighting for its life against the quebec government and is pretty underfunded so i have no idea what the future of mcgill will be\n   11. it takes so much effort to transfer to literally any other program in case i change my mind (which i have done a quadrillion times)\n   12. little to no flexibility in electives/minors/double majors because of super rigid curriculum\n2. **UCLA CaSB**\n   1. 26k --> will need to take federal loans (no private tho) and will likely place a financial strain on my family\n      1. EDIT: i will likely have to take 20-25k total in federal loans\n   2. has a much stronger focus on CS, which is way better for both my interest in computational structural biology + potentially becoming a SWE sellout\n   3. minors and double majors in so many fields i am interested in!! they literally have a minor in structural biology i'm in love <3\n   4. will have to fight my way through more GEs. i have 2/3 of them done but i would prefer to never take another again. especially more english classes oh my god\n   5. weather, food, and guaranteed housing are really nice additional benefits!\n      1. i hate how isolating the campus can be without a car however\n   6. PREMED HELL WHY ARE THEY ALL HERE\n      1. it is nice that there is a really good medical school right there for any biomedical research\n   7. can finish in 3 years if i take summer CC classes and pray that my enrollment times don't screw me over\n   8. can complete my masters in one extra year!\n   9. my best friend is going here! some of my friends are going here so i won't be completely isolated in case i need social support\n   10. way less travel costs!\n3. **UCB ChemBio**\n   1. 31k --> will need to take federal + private loans w/ strain on family\n      1. BUT i can commute after the first year and cal becomes my cheapest option. i would rather die than spend another 3 years living with my parents and battling my way on the freeway to berkeley, but money is money. there's also bart but its 50 minutes with a transfer :(\n   2. has a much weaker focus on CS in exchange for a super in-depth education of biochemistry\n      1. can focus on computational chemistry tho\n   3. literally one of the best programs in the nation for chemistry?? super heavy on research and has great grad school outcomes\n      1. literally has its own college for CoC --> smaller college feel\n      2. i can just casually work with nobel prize winners???\n   4. any concerns about safety, weather, and the bay area do not apply to me i literally live here\n   5. same GE issue that UCLA suffers from, but to a lesser extent due to the CoC being a separate thing\n   6. nonexistent travel costs and i can stay close to my sister!\n   7. can easily finish in 3 years even without CC because of how little classes are required for some reason\n   8. surrounded by biotech companies that love berkeley grads, though chemistry is not really an employable degree in that sense\n4. **UBC Applied Sciences**\n   1. 7000 USD tuition and way more expensive living than montreal, BUT it is still under 20k USD and the co-op program will likely cover the difference\n   2. if i was worried about mcgill taking 5 years, ubc w/ co-op is almost 6!\n      1. the co-op program + the engineering degree will have the best earning potential after a bachelor out of any of my options\n      2. EDIT: room and board is around 10k USD on campus, and i would prefer to stay on campus due to how bad the housing situation is in vancouver + the campus is isolated with a miniscule housing market\n   3. slightly more GEs than McGill but still nothing compared to UCs\n   4. the literal hunger games to get into your preferred engineering major\n   5. has a top 3 engineering program in canada and a fantastic reputation in the pacific northwest, one of my favorite regions in the world :)\n      1. i also have no idea if i like any other sort of engineering than biological. maybe chemical?  the general first year would help but it might also be a pain in the ass if i discover engineering wasn't my thing\n      2. oh the campus is also the prettiest campus i have ever seen. surrounded by beach on all three sides with the pacific ocean and a mountain range as its backdrop. search it up, you will not be disappointed!\n   6. out of all of my options, this option fits my current interests the least\n   7. the pacific northwest is known for being socially cold + i will have literally no one i know for hundreds of miles --> could be an impending social disaster\n5. **UCSD Biology w/ Bioinformatics**\n   1. 29k --> similar situation to berkeley right now\n   2. UCSD's bioinformatics program is the best in the world. full stop. if i want to really dive deep into bioinformatics and pursue it in grad school, ucsd is a no-brainer for opportunities it provides\n      1. unfortunately, bioinformatics is much more genomics based and has little to no emphasis on structural biology, which is more a mathematical modeling subject, so ucsd is currently my last choice out of the 5\n   3. the campus is gorgeous, likely has the best weather on earth, has a cool residential college system, and surrounded by a ton of biotech companies\n   4. i honestly have not thought too much about ucsd after getting into ucb and ucla, but i still it deserves consideration so let me know if there's anything else i should keep in mind!\n\n**Advice**\n\n* program prestige is a much bigger deal than school prestige in most situations! this especially applies to canadian schools. the only reason why ucsd and ubc are still in consideration is solely because of the strength of their programs, not the relative \"prestige\" of the schools! choose the school that offers the best program for your needs, not the program with the fancier name\n   * this doesn't apply if the school is nice about transferring majors. almost every large public university is an ass about switching majors, especially in in-demand majors\n* if you are in california, PLEASE DO CC CLASSES! UCs love them, your GPA loves them, and your wallet loves them. they are literally guaranteed to transfer and can get you out of so many classes you don't care about. please stop drooling over random APs and look at CC classes that actually interest you!\n* only apply to schools that are within the realm of financial feasibility. do every single npc you can and use those numbers to decide whats possible and what isn't. i was originally going to apply to the ivy league, but i decided against it after seeing how much more expensive they would be\n* ignore 99% of the advice you hear about ECs online. literally do what makes you happy and do it well! scioly carried my entire application because i love/hate it so much :)\n\n**Thank you!**\n\n\n\nEDIT: I chose McGill! The bioengineering program is super cool and the financial freedom is unparalleled :) Thanks for all the help!"

However, as we get closer to decision day, I am still incredibly torn between which school to choose. I\u2019ve identified the University of Michigan and the Clemson Honors College as my two best options (Michigan being the highest ranked CS program I got into, and Clemson Honors College on a return on investment basis).\n\nWhile cost is not an issue, as even Michigan wouldn\u2019t change my family's quality of living, thinking in terms of return on investment, I\u2019m not sure if I would gain the roughly $45k in tuition difference by going to Michigan. Additionally, I'm not completely sure how applicable Michigan's CS prestige is to me, as my major is housed in the college of Literature, Sciences, and Arts (BS-granting), opposed to the college of engineering (BSE-granting).\u00a0\n\nWhile I'm currently leaning towards Michigan and my solely-prestige-focused Asian parents are supporting this, seeing the sheer amount of high-achieving peers vying for the Clemson Honors College is making me feel extremely convoluted, and as it gets closer to decision day, increasingly dread picking the wrong option.\n\nUpdate: Not sure how it would affect my decision, but I just got into the LSA honors program at Michigan today."

Worked to expand my nonprofits efforts underprivileged kids in my city by creating a camp specifically for them. Raised 30k+, Worked with 200+ students.*\n2. Co-Founder of Travel Itinerary App \u2013 Created app allowing users to build travel itineraries customized to their interests by inputting AI-based prompts. Ranked #1 in a computer science event at FBLA Nationals; Recognized by my Rep in U.S. House of Reps for its potential to boost local tourism when submitted to Congressional App Challenge\n3. Co-Founder of \u201cUgly\u201d Produce Donation App \u2013 Created app allowing food producers (i.e. farmers) to scan their produce and distinguish between \u201cugly\u201d (good to eat, but won\u2019t sell in a store due to irregular physical appearance) and inedible produce. On the flip side, the app also featured a Door Dash for Drivers-style Platform so that volunteers could coordinate efforts to collect and donate the ugly produce to food banks. My team and I were recognized by the UN Global NGO Committee as having a potential solution for some of their Sustainable Development Goals.\n4. Data Science Consultant (Not-for-profit) for local aerobics training gym \u2013 Created \\~100 reports forecasting various aerobics classes\u2019 attendance; Made suggestions to optimize class schedule to boost attendance\n5. Founder of Machine Learning Paper Explanation Blog \u2013 Picked 100 important papers from Natural Language Processing and explained them in an easy-to-understand way, with the intention of creating a soft introduction to the field. 165 posts were dedicated to covering the content of the papers; another 100 were dedicated to explaining their significance for the field of Natural Language Processing (265 \\~400-word posts total).\n6. Founder/Software Engineering of linguistic corpus (database) for my native language \u2013 Pulled freely available articles/speeches on the internet for my native language into an organized corpus. Speeches were transcribed. Words/Sentences from both the articles and speeches were divided by emotion and age (how old the media in which they were found was). The goal was to track changes in the language over time.\n7. Founder of History of Data Science blog \u2013 Made 120 300-word posts on the history of data science (60 on new technologies, 30 on scientists, 30 on societal impacts of data science advances, with a focus on race relations). For instance, one post was about how facial recognition technology could lead to racial profiling.\n8. Founder of website providing a real-time, updating report about teenage drug addiction \u2013 The website continuously scrapes social media to collect information about teenage drug use. It uses Natural Language Processing to identify key words within the social media posts, so it can cheaply and quickly detect new trends in drug usage. The purpose is to supplement the NIH survey about teenage drug usage, as it circumvents the issue of underreporting. I presented it as a project at my state\u2019s science fair, where it won 3^(rd) in the Computer Science category.\n9. Indian Classical Music Tutor/Performer \u2013 I sang with a few famous Indian Classical Musicians when they came to visit my city. My singing is featured on their YouTube channel with \\~50k subscribers. I also tutored a few students in this music form.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1.

College Hackathons - Ranked 1/\\~650 in an international college hackathon; Won \\~5k prize; Ranked 3rd in a different state-wide college hackathon\n3. State Science Fair \u2013 3^(rd) place in Computer Science Category, 4^(th) place in Computer Science Category in different years\n4. PennApps Invitation (Was accepted by PennApps, a UPenn Computer Science club, to their on-campus hackathon). As far as I know, my team and I were the only high schoolers there; everyone else seemed to be from colleges.\n5. State History Fair \u2013 National Qualifier in my category (awarded to top two entries per category per state)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCounselor: 7-8/10 \u2013 He knows and likes me. I\u2019m in his office often and we have a relaxed rapport. His letter of recommendation emphasized that I was interested in the intersection of service and STEM.\n\nIB/AP Calc Math Teacher: 8/10 \u2013 He has had me for 3 years now (between AP and IB classes) and knows me well. His letter spent some time discussing concrete ways in which I have helped others in his class (for instance, holding AP Calc review sessions for other students).\n\nIB English Teacher: 8/10 \u2013 It\u2019s worth noting that I consistently tend to score in the top 10% of students in her class on all important projects/assessments because this proves that she has found my writing to be of better quality than most other students. Her letter was similar to Math Teacher in that she has had me for multiple years and her letter detailed information about how I helped other students in her classes by clarifying classwork, reviewing essay, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Interviews**\n\nPrinceton \u2013 6/10. This was my first one; It was quick, and the conversation was surface level. Not terrible or anything; just not amazing.\n\nHarvard \u2013 8/10. Connected well with interviewer, and she seemed interested in my extracurriculars (especially the Ugly Food Donation App \u2013 the fourth extracurricular)\n\nStanford \u2013 8/10. Chill guy; we spent roe time talking about what I would want to do on campus at Stanford if I got in rather than the extracurriculars I had done in the past.\n\nRice \u2013 9/10. I knew the guy\u2019s son because he worked with me at the nonprofit. We spent a lot of time talking about socioeconomic equality in education.\n\nDuke \u2013 6/10. By far the most intellectually stimulating conversation. My interviewer\u2019s parents were sociologists, so we had plenty to talk about. However, the guy seemed like he was in a hurry (I think he was working, but idk really).\n\nYale \u2013 No interview; bad sign\n\nPenn \u2013 No interview; bad sign\n\nCornell \u2013 No interview; Cornell interviewed nobody form my region, as far as I know. However, I don\u2019t think this was necessarily a bad sign or anything because they stress that their interviews don\u2019t matter and a couple people did get in without interviews.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App seemed good, from what I can tell. I had a few people (family friends, like professors and other students) look over it. It is about a conversation I had with my little brother about our favorite superpowers when we were little. I used our choices as metaphors for our personalities; mine being timid and his being outgoing. The rest of the essay was centered around how I grew to become more confident and display leader-like qualities.\n\nPrinceton and Yale supplementals sucked because they were the first few I worked on. Northwestern supplementals also could\u2019ve been better because I added it last minute.\n\nOtherwise, essay quality seemed solid. I followed College Essay Guy\u2019s tips on how to write each supplemental. I will note that the time spent working on supplementals and the results had virtually no correlation. Moreover, I only had my mom look over them.\n\nNot sure how I could numerically rate essay quality, tbh.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**20 Schools: 4 Acceptances, 3 Waitlists, 13 Rejections**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Emory (both Atlanta and Oxford Campuses) RD - Major: Quantitative Sciences, which is basically Data Science\n   * Rejected from Woodruff Scholarship (Full Ride) at both campuses\n   * Not very affordable for my family\n* UNC Chapel Hill RD (Out of state) \u2013 Major: Statistics and Analytics\n   * I applied to this mostly because of the Robertson Scholarship, which I didn\u2019t get.\n* University of South Florida (Out of state) \u2013 Major: Biomedical Sciences\n   * Full ride for National Merit Scholarship, eligible for 7-year BS/MD program (however, the MCAT requirement is insane).\n* T100 Instate school \u2013 Major: Applied Mathematics\n   * Near full ride (based on grades and course rigour)\n\n*Waitlists (I\u2019m going to remain on all of these, in case one of them comes through and ends up being affordable; However, EFC indicates that all of them are going to cost as much as Emory, so I am not too hopeful here):*\n\n* Columbia \u2013 Major: Statistics\n* Vanderbilt \u2013 Major: Math\n* Rice \u2013 Major: Social Policy Analysis (Sociology + Statistics, essentially)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Yale REA\n* UChicago ED2 (This one really hurt; I tried to be as quirky as I could on my essays here and genuinely had so much fun writing them. EFC was also by far the cheapest of every school, so I could\u2019ve easily afforded this place had I gotten in.)\n* Brown RD\n* Caltech RD\n* Cornell RD\n* Duke RD\n* Harvard RD\n* Johns Hopkins RD\n* Northwestern RD\n* Princeton RD\n* Stanford RD\n* Swarthmore RD\n* Penn RD (This one also stung; I thought the PennApps attendance would help here. I wanted to ED1 here but concerns over finances stopped me.)\n\n**Additional Information/Reflections:**\n\nNot sure what I should\u2019ve done better really, in terms of building a Curricular/Extracurricular profile. I guess I kinda wish I had done research and published somewhere. While it is by no means a requirement, I feel like a lot of high schoolers (at least in my area) are starting to do it now.\n\nFurthermore, I feel like the Emory acceptance and the multiple waitlists proves that my essays were good and taken seriously by the admissions officers reading my application.\n\nFinally, I wish I had applied to some slightly lower ranked schools (i.e. Boston University) for the potential of receiving merit aid.\n\nFeel free to leave any thoughts below (whether it be on my profile, school list, or anything else)."

However, my parents wanted me to shoot way higher, and thus\u00a0this\u00a0monstrosity of a list was born. Over the application season, my friends, teachers, and counselor continually fed into my delusions that maybe I could get into these crazy, single-digit acceptance rate schools. At some point, I learned I had the highest SAT score in the school and my ego just went through the roof. Come March 28, the rejections hurt, but it's obvious now that I was never T20 material.\n\nMy principal has been asking me in passing about my decisions. He told me sometime back that he could really see me at\u00a0Cornell,\u00a0and thinks I have what it takes to get in. I don't have the heart to tell him about my results. Being an NJ resident, it sucks to see all the stellar public school students getting into selective schools, meanwhile, in my private school, no one's gotten into a T20 in four years. I've wasted my parents' time and money for what?\u00a0\n\nThese few acceptances are good, but everything is a tad too expensive. I wish I could go back in time and punch myself for giving in to what others thought would be\u00a0right\u00a0for me. I'm really not happy with my options, or my major. I don't have any passions. I wish I worked harder, was more outgoing, had more impactful ECs, etc. etc. But it's too late. Sorry for the entitlement and whining, I\u00a0just had to let it all out :D"

However, I come from a less than middle-class background, and neither my father nor I own property to secure a substantial loan. This limitation adds another layer of complexity to my journey.\n\nGiven my financial constraints, I'm seeking practical advice on how to navigate the path to US education and employment. Accommodation costs and the prospect of repaying a loan are daunting prospects for me. \n\nI'm hoping to hear from individuals who have faced similar challenges or have insights into alternative funding options, realistic scholarship opportunities, and potential pathways to secure employment post-graduation in the US. \n\nYour practical advice, shared experiences, and realistic perspectives would be immensely valuable as I chart my course forward. Thank you all for your support and guidance!"

        "post": "Hey guys so the title sums it up pretty well. I want to major in finance and I am struggling to decide on which school to decide. I narrowed it down to 2 schools - University of Michigan and UCLA. At Michigan I got into the Ross School of Business and would double major with a BBA and a major in mathematics of risk management and finance. On the other hand, at UCLA I would major in financial and actuarial mathematics and business economics. I may also get an accounting minor. I am really struggling with this decision and have received many mixed opinions. Let me know what you guys think, anything would help to make the decision easier. As for financial aid, I would not qualify for much at either school and their costs are similar.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen the comments and I know that Michigan has a much stronger finance program than UCLA. The only reason I\u2019m swaying towards UCLA is because I loved the campus a lot more and apparently through prestigious clubs and student organizations at the university I will still have strong opportunities for finance. UCLA also has a very strong math department which is important to me as that is something I\u2019m quite interested in. Michigan has much better resources for my major at Ross which may set me up better career wise which is why this decision has been quite difficult for me."

But maybe unique topic??\n \nSupplements: Kind of did not spend more than 6 hours on any one supplement \ud83d\ude42 I reused like 5 supplements, my why school and why major were combined into one supp and I just changed names/words \u2764\ufe0f I did have one community/contribution supp which I think I cooked on, but everything else was a bit \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 do NOT recommend doing this I still regret it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* In-state safety (80%+ acceptance rate), Rolling \n* UT Dallas (+National Merit package), Rolling\n* University of Central Florida, Rolling \n* Case Western Reserve University (+40k per year), EA\n* Purdue (+10k per year), EA\n* University of Washington, Seattle (+5k per year), RD\n* UC Davis, RD\n* Cornell (??!!), RD\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Northeastern, RD\n* Duke, RD\n* Brown, RD\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT, RD\n* Boston University, RD\n* USC, EA (deferred) \u2014> rejected RD\n* UC San Diego, RD\n\n**Additional Information:**\n* Took freshman year online?\n* Tried not to be too specific for anonymity \ud83d\ude2d not sure if it worked\n\nClosing thoughts:\nSo late to the party but I wanted to post my results in the hopes it will give other applicants some hope or insight!\nI know I have great stats but the way everyone talks, I thought I was done for because I had no research, internships, sports, fine arts, etc etc\u2026 and my strongest ECs were relatively small school-contained clubs. \nAdmissions is really a lottery and you have no idea what these schools are looking for. I\u2019m so so grateful and lucky to have gotten the results I did, and I still can\u2019t quite believe it sometimes. So I just want to encourage y\u2019all to take that shot, even if you don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a chance. \n\n&#x200B;\nWith that said, I am still not 100% committed yet and have mostly narrowed my choices down to CWRU vs. Cornell (I\u2019m leaning towards a private school vs public). CWRU would be about half the price, though price is not really an issue. My heart says Cornell, but I\u2019m a bit scared of the rumors of cut-throat competitiveness and grade deflation, and CWRU seems lovely too. I plan on going straight into the job market after graduation (though that could change). UT Dallas (near full ride) and Purdue are also on the back burner\u2026 if anyone has any insight it would be greatly appreciated!"

For location, I usually prefer bigger cities.  \nUC Berkeley:  \nPros: Has the most prestige for my major compared to the other schools. Has very extensive research programs. My family wants me to go here because its best for my major and because of its international prestige.  \nCons: Very large school with large classes so it could be harder for me to connect with my professors and get the help I need. Has housing issues and my parents and I want me to stay in the dorms for all 4 years and Berk only guarantees 1 year. Food is also not amazing here.  \nCost: idk yet but i'm out of state so 83k pre-FAFSA.  \nBrown:  \nPros: Open curriculum so I am able to take more classes that I am interested in. Grade inflation and no GPA so I probably will have a relatively less stressful time here compared to the other schools. Ivy so lots of prestige. I am also guaranteed dorms all 4 years.  \nCons: Dorms and food are rated pretty low. Not rated as high for my major compared to Berk.  \nCost: 33k  \nRice:  \nPros: Probably the most happy school and take cares of their students very well. Has good food and in a big city which I like. Also the cheapest for me as they gave me the most financial aid. Small school so able to connect with professors better. Has residential colleges so I will be in a tight knit community that supports each other.  \nCons: Not as prestigious as the other 2 schools.  \nCost: 18k"

I also read over hundreds of other essays people wrote and what worked well. I think I did the best job I could at explaining everything and emphasizing the impact I can have and the uniqueness of my situation. I think the reason I got rejected from so many schools is that I didn't have an excuse for my poor grades early on, or at least not one worth mentioning.

Sometimes, my essays were a bit risky, but I tried to be different without being cringe, and I think it worked very well.\n\n**BIG TIP: Connect your academic work to your story or personal life; I did this in interviews as well.

The sense I get is Kelley no doubt has better reputation/ranking compared to Mays but seems to be worth it (especially with out of state tuition for me) only if I'm interested in Finance major and be able to crack into one of the hyper competitive workshops like IBW or IMW. During Kelley info session of Red Carpet Day, Kelley director was saying a good chunck of companies hiring from Kelley are looking for Finance majors. My aim is to get a decent job after undergrad, work for 2-3 yrs and go to law school. At this time, I'm not sure whether I would be interested in Finance or any other track in specific. Hence when I applying for Kelley, I chose \"Exploratory business\" in Commonapp and that's what I got into as a direct admit. I also got accepted into Kelley's \"ACE( Advanced Curricular Experience)\" program which is supposedly an easier path (relatively speaking) into  Business Honors. As far as Mays, I know there are several \"High Impact\" programs which I believe are similar to Kelley Workshops and I also know cracking into Mays Business Honors as a freshman is extremely difficult. Given all this, any suggesttions/recommendations would be great while I completely understand it's ultimately a personal choice and a financial decision. Thank you in advance!"

I wonder what the community might think, really struggling.\n\nThe combatants are UC Berkeley (OOS) vs Tufts.\n\nThe price for each is virtually the same unfortunately.\n\nThe intended major is in Biology / Biochemistry. At both schools, you have the ability to declare down the road after actually experiencing different classes which I love. The long term goal has a possibility of Medical School, but who knows if I'll still want that in 4 years.\n\nBerkeley Pros:\n\nName\n\nRigor - \"If you can make it here, you'll make it anywhere\"\n\nPotential to form connections with amazing fellow students and researchers for the future.\n\nBerkeley Negatives:\n\nHorrible housing situation - dorm only guaranteed for 1st year and more expensive, challenging to find a place to be each year\n\nA bit unsafe area, but nowhere near what people seem to make it out to be in my mind\n\nSocially maybe a bit more reclusive, harder to find friends, perhaps overly competitive\n\nEven if focused on Biochemistry and focus on those classes, the diploma won't say Biochemistry. (may not matter)\n\nMany teachers are may be there primarily for research and may not be so skilled at teaching.\n\nTufts Pros:\n\nMuch smaller school and much higher faculty/student ratio - arguably better teachers (vs researchers)\n\nMuch better chance to talk to, work with professors\n\nAmazing campus situation in regards to being in a nice area, yet easy access to surrounding area near Boston\n\n4 years dorm living is not a problem\n\nTufts Negatives:\n\nName is well known by some, completely unknown by others, especially outside New England. Paying a very high price for \"prestige\" without necessarily getting the \"prestige\".\n\nSmall, kind of secluded location (also see Pros)\n\nMassachusetts winters.\n\nFaculty accessible but not seen as world leaders in their field\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any/all thoughts/advice are much appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts on this, very helpful! More opinions welcome. :) Upvoted all of you!"

I'm aware it is very competitive.\n\nAt TAMU I have been accepted to Engineering which allows me to choose a major after the first year. If I join TAMU  I'll probably major in MechE. As a National Merit Finalist, I am getting a generous scholarship at TAMU, where my total cost of attendance will be around 90K (compared to 250K at UIUC and 190K at Purdue).\n\nWith the decision date fast approaching, I'm now trying to figure out which one I should pick. Would appreciate your comments and feedback to help me in the process."

So I worked with around 2000 people who spoke the language online to help me learn how to translate the language into English, and I\u2019m currently continuing to develop this translator.\n\n\\#5 Nat'l Student Advisor | Elected 1/70 Nationally for a Academic Program that brings College Credit Classes to High SchoolsTeamed w/ CEO, Student Success Director & 70 advisors to improve teacher-student-contact; Nominated speaker @ departure ceremony (100+ attendees).\n\n\\#6 High School Law Student at a  High School program at a local Law SchoolAscertained criminal & constitutional law w/ 4 Teaching Assistants & \\~30 students weekly; Explored the influence of law's meticulous language.\n\n\\#7 \u200b\u200bSpanish Translator & Sub-titler, TEDxTranslated & edited 50+ Speeches from English to Spanish; Recruited & Counseled 10 volunteers on linguistic, subtitling/translation inquiries.\n\n\\#8 \u200b\u200bHigh School Law Student at a Law School Program onlineStudied US Legal System & Constitutional Law w/ 30 students & TA; Researched 5 Constitutional cases; Playfully questioned ice cream's legal definition\n\n\\#9 Grassroots Activist Volunteer, State Senate CampaignPiloted a group of 5 volunteers; Networked w/ Candidate & Local City Official.

She loved how I was the first in my High School to take the National Greek Exam and continue to take the National Latin Exam. Overall, was very impressed with me and regarding our relationship, she commends how I present myself to faculty and in the classroom. I think it\u2019s safe to say her letter was glowing.\n\n**Cloud Computing Teacher**:We vibe and click easily, we both have an animated and sarcastic sense of humor, I\u2019d go on to say dramatic personalities. I also won\u2019t rate it but he also expressed how he wrote a detailed and \u201ccharming\u201d letter. When I was talking about my recommendation letter to him, he expressed how \u201ceveryone (in my school) knows these colleges are gonna accept you.\u201d Aside from building onto my ever-evolving delusions, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have that level of support from my teachers. In case he were to be lazy about writing it, I made sure my brag sheet was detailed and charmingly written if he decided to copy paste it.\n\n**Counselor:** We had to fill out a form asking us standard questions that\u2019ll give her more details to consider when writing her recommendation letters. I made sure I added a lot of context and substance to my responses which she appreciated. We have a warm and comfortable relationship, like a cozy cabin. She learned a lot about me this year through my essays.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n**Harvard:** Not what I expected, the interviewer was mainly focused on my academic interests and extracurricular activities. Didn\u2019t ask to introduce myself nor asked why Harvard, or any typical questions, which might\u2019ve worked out for me. She did misinterpret one of my jokes and answers but she seemed really impressed with how fast I learned languages. She grew an interest in why I began learning an American Creole Language as well as my unconventional way of learning Ukrainian through snooping Instagram Comment Sections. She asked a lot of \u201cwhy\u201d questions to what I said. Decently positive experience, wasn\u2019t bad, might\u2019ve gone better, but I\u2019m pleased with the conversation I had.\n\n**Princeton:** Made me fall in love with Princeton, and connected with the interviewer quickly. Didn't gain anything from it other than Princeton was a great fit for me and had fun talking to my interviewer\n\n**Macaulay Honors College @ Hunter:** Could've been better but I did act like myself, even with the pressure of 3 interviewers all at once.**Essays**\n\n(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\n**Personal Statement:** Began working on it as soon as Common App opened, and finished it like 2 weeks before New Years. Candidly, it might\u2019ve been a wiser idea to work equally on my supplemental essays but it\u2019s too late for that now. Everyone who read my common app essay LOVED it. I told the story of me ambitiously trying to learn Mandarin in a week to better communicate with the manager of my local Laundromat, and embarrassingly making a mistake when I delusionally tried to speak to her. My reflection was the climax of my work. It was a charming essay that spoke a lot about me. My AP Lit Teacher was impressed with it and instead of critiquing it, he praised it, even calling it beautifully written, which is rare for him to say about student essays. My college counselor loved it and couldn\u2019t think of any suggestions, and my family members who read it thought it was beautiful and even made my sister in law tear up a bit. Might be safe to say it\u2019s a nice essay\n\nI spent about a week or two writing my other supplemental essays for schools, recycled a lot of them, but personalized it for each school.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances:**SUNY Stony BrookSUNY BinghamtonSUNY UBuffaloSUNY UAlbanySUNY New PaltzSUNY PurchaseSUNY OswegoSUNY Buffalo State**Macaulay Honors College @ Hunter** (Shocked but happy)CUNY Baruch CollegeCUNY Hunter CollegeCUNY City CollegeCUNY Brooklyn CollegeCUNY Lehman CollegeCUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice**Columbia University** (**Committing!)Cornell University** (**YAY)**\\*\\*New York University (\\*\\*Shanghai but a win is a win)                                                                                      Stevens Institute of TechnologyFordham UniversityRochester Institute of TechnologyNew York Institute of TechnologyAmerican University**Middlebury College** (Applied on a whim and slowly fell in love with it <3 would've loved to attend, maybe in another life)The New School\n\n**Withdrawn:**Johns Hopkins University\n\n**Waitlists:**Vanderbilt University\t(Very happy and shocked)Syracuse University (Surprise but it's perfectly fine)SUNY Geneseo\n\n**Rejections**Harvard UniversityPrinceton UniverisityYale UniversityUPennBrown UniversityDartmouth CollegeNortheastern University\n\n**Reflection:**It does not hurt to dream or to have a vision.

Not sure how reliable this opinion is!)\n\n1. **HISTORY/ECON TEACHER** (9/10) \u2013 Extremely close to him from the start of 10th grade. He supervised + advised my oral history project during my time TAing for him. Said that my recc letter was the best & easiest he's ever written in his decades of teaching. \n2. **ENGLISH TEACHER** (8/10) \u2013 Also close to him, but not as close to him as #1. 11th and 12th; got to see a lot of my writing skills (creative, argumentative, analytical), as well as my public speaking skills. \n3. **STATE SENATOR** (6/10) \u2013 Worked with him a bunch for internships. He's pretty involved in Harvard's community and is a Harvard alum. Not sure if this had an impact at all, tbh. \n\n  \n**Interviews**\n\n1. **Brandeis** (Optional) \u2013 7/10\n   1. 15 minute in-person interview with a Brandeis admission employee who was a year older than me! Talked about my passion about political science and campaigning with her, who was also interested in polisci. 15 minute interview doesn't really do much though, but maybe it did get me the fat package I got? \n2. **Tufts** (Optional) \u2013 9/10\n   1. 30 minute Zoom interview turned into 1.5 hours. Didn't realize my interviewer was literally a part of Tufts' Office of Trustees until after! We talked about Tufts only briefly because I knew a lot from hanging around Tufts campus while my dad was working + participating in Tufts' faculty community events. The other one hour was us talking about our town's politics, my school's culture (she had a younger child in private school and was curious about my town's public school), my campaign experience, which I thought went really well! \n      1. PS\u2013 she ended up congratulating me on my acceptance 30 minutes after my acceptance result came out and asked if we could go get coffee together + offered a personal campus tour!\n3. **Georgetown** \u2013 3/10\n   1. This was horrible. My very first interview and my interviewer made it very uncomfortable for me to talk about my struggles as a POC and political advocacy, so my interview felt very bland and one-sided. (She was very much legacy, white, and wealthy). She also kept emphasizing how she had multiple of these and how she was on a very strict time limit, which made me feel as if she were rushing me and that I was a waste of her time. I'm 99% sure she had crammed all of her interviews on that Saturday, so.\n4. **Princeton** \u2013 5/10\n   1. Not horrible, not great. My interviewer and I met in a local cafe and she talked about herself more than there was room to talk about me. Overall, I left feeling like I could've said more about myself, but there was also no time/space to do so.\n5. **Harvard** \u2013 7/10\n   1. My best interview. My interviewer very much made the interview feel like a conversation and she was genuinely interested in the political work I had done despite us having completely different interests (her, a STEM major, me, humanities). By the end, I felt like I had given it my best shot and she seemed relatively pleased. \n\n**Essays**  \nNot great, not bad. Nothing outstanding, I would say, but definitely above average. My CommonApp and my supplements reflected my passions for politics as well as my background and passions as a regular human.   \n**Decisions**  \nAcceptances:\n\n* UMass Amherst (in-state) \u2013 EA\n* University of Vermont ($84K + Honors) \u2013 EA\n* Brandeis (Humanities Fellow Scholarship: $96K, Intl Business Scholars Program) \u2013 RD\n* Tufts \u2013 RD -> COMMITTED \n   * I get free tuition, so this was a no brainer out of all of my decisions! + excellent IR program and close to home. \n* Northeastern NUin ($36K) \u2013 EA\n* Wesleyan \u2013 RD\n\nGuaranteed Transfer:\n\n*  Boston University \u2013 RD \n\nWaitlists:\n\n* Colby \u2013 RD\n* Middlebury \u2013 RD\n* NYU \u2013 RD\n* Williams \u2013 RD\n* Harvard \u2013 RD\n\nRejections:\n\n* Columbia \u2013 ED\n* Brown \u2013 RD\n* Yale \u2013\u00a0RD\n* Princeton \u2013 RD\n* Georgetown \u2013 RD\n\n**Comments**: \n\nYou're probably wondering why I didn't ED to Tufts knowing that they have an incredible IR program and get free tuition and are close to home. I don't know. My parents wanted me to give a shot at other schools and they were willing to pay more money if I had gotten into a better school, but we agreed that otherwise I would be going to Tufts. I feel really fortunate and lucky for being in the position that I'm in, and although this process was literal hell it all worked out! "

I'm grateful for being in a good state (and the rest of these decisions)!! \n\nwhat i included throughout this post was my stuff from RD. i kinda just redid most things on my application and grinded after hearing back from duke early... i completely redid my common app essay (way diff topic, originally talked about my love for math with puzzles and stuff), i took the act AGAIN, i fixed all my supplementals (but i used the same topics as before), changed some ecs/awards around. idk it was a rough few weeks right before rd deadlines but it worked out!! \n\ni mean after i had heard back from unc around Jan 30th,  I was happy after that. I wasn't rlly expecting anything bc i was STRUGGLING w/ rd applications. lord knows i did not expect mit. i thought it was all over after the deferral. I'm excited for this chapter to end tho and the next four years to come!! \n\ni wouldn't wish the college process upon anyone... genuinely the most stressful time of my life. I'm forever grateful for these results though and to have great options. "

If you have any advice, or you want to ask me anything about my application process, feel free to comment or DM. \n\n\r  \nFYI, my courses/ECs are a bit weird because I moved halfway through highschool, from an American public school to an international private school, from which I will graduate with an IB diploma.\n\n\r  \n**Demographics**\r  \nGender: Male\r  \nRace/Ethnicity: White\r  \nResidence: In-state for Virginia, currently residing abroad\r  \nIncome Bracket: Upper-middle\r  \nType of School: Private international school; IB Diploma program\r  \nHooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None\n\n\r  \n**Intended Major(s): Political Science and Environmental Science**\n\n\r  \n**Academics**\r  \nGPA (UW/W): 4.28\r  \nRank (or percentile): N/A\r  \n\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 1 AP, 6 IB\r  \nSenior Year Course Load: (IB curriculum) Music HL, English A HL, History HL, French B SL, Math SL, Environmental Systems/Societies SL, Theory of Knowledge\n\n\r  \n**Standardized Testing**\r\r  \nSAT: 1490 (770RW, 720M)\r  \nAP/IB: AP World History (5), Predicted IB score of 45\n\n\r  \n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\r  \n\r  \nInternship with a US embassy, including learning/doing home renovations for diplomats and organizing a charity drive\n\n\r  \nModel UN - I run the club and have won best delegate at a major int\u2019l conference for 2 years in a row. I\u2019ve won 5 other awards at other conferences as well. Currently handing the club over to my successors.\n\n\r  \nSchool DEI initiative - I am a founding member. Have helped draft a statement of inclusion, coordinate school involvement at local pride parade, organize response to epidemic of sexism/harrassment in lower grade levels, and start anti-bullying campaign. \n\n\r  \nMarching band/band - my old school had a fantastic marching band I was in, and I\u2019ve kept up in a few smaller ensembles since moving, most notably I\u2019ve played in the pit for 2 musicals.\n\n\r  \nSchool volunteering team - I\u2019ve done a lot of campaigning/fundraising work for this school team that funds a childrens center abroad. I don\u2019t play a pivotal role, but I\u2019ve done some noteworthy grunt work ig. \n\n\r  \nBaking club - I founded and led my old school\u2019s baking club until I moved :/. Club included weekly bake-offs where the winner would be chosen by popular vote, and then they could pick the next week\u2019s theme. Super fun, kinda bummed I had to leave it behind. \n\n\r  \nTrivia team - also at my old school. Our team did surprisingly well, winning some regional/state level competitions and going to a national tournament in Atlanta. I was a team captain on a few occasions, but I wouldn\u2019t say I was ever the most prominent/important player.\n\n\r  \nFrench - not super important, but I take learning French quite seriously so I do some work out of school. \n\n\r  \n**Awards/Honors**\r\r  \nNational Merit Scholarship Commended Scholar\r  \nLeadership award (school-based)\r  \nAcademic performance award (school-based)\r  \nBest delegate award at most recent int\u2019l conference (\\~500 delegates)\r  \nPerformance award for marching band (school-based)\n\n\r  \n**Letters of Recommendation**\r  \nHistory teacher - 10/10. My history teacher has had a genuine influence on my education and perspective. We are both founding members of my school DEI initiative (see above) so, aside from classwork, we\u2019ve done a lot of work together for the school community. I also put forward my best work in her class because I have a lot of genuine respect for her both as a teacher and a person. I didn\u2019t get to read the full rec, but what I did see was personal and heartfelt, with good reference to some of my finer work in history class, and my efforts for the DEI team. Probably one of the strongest components of my application overall.\n\n\r  \nEnvironmental Science Teacher - 7/10. We aren\u2019t super close, but I put a lot into her class because I\u2019m gonna major in Environmental Science. I didn\u2019t see much of the rec, but I know she talked about a research assignment I did particularly well on, and mentioned my work on a class research trip we took last year. \n\n\r  \nCounselor rec - ?/10. I\u2019m on pretty good terms with my counselor, but I didn\u2019t get to see any of their rec letter. I suspect it was quite good, but I can\u2019t be sure. \n\n\r  \n**Interviews**\r  \nOxford (UK) - I was shortlisted and interviewed twice for PPE (St. Catz college). The first interview was with 2 econ professors, probably a 6/10. I gave a few good answers, one not-so-good answer, and I had fun, which I think they appreciated. The second interview was not as great, 4/10. The politics professor definitely wasn\u2019t fond of the responses I gave, and my wifi picked a really awful time to crap out on me. The philosophy professor was much better, and I had fun like with the econ interview, but I definitely wasn\u2019t able to make a positive impression. I kinda knew it was over for me after the second interview. \n\n\r  \n**Essays**\r  \nCommonApp Essay - 8.5/10. I wrote about how moving so much has left me with fundamental knowledge about the meaning of resilience, using examples like growing up gay and Saudi Arabia, and using that experience as motivation to study politics so I can eventually work against the policies that absolutely sucked for me. I tried not to make the essay a sob story/trauma dump, focusing more on what I took out of my different experiences and how I plan to use that info in my career instead of how hard it was/how much it sucked. \n\n\r  \nPersonal Statement - 5/10. I had a really hard time trying to write with British formality. I wrote about books I used in my study of Politics, Philosophy, and Economics, but in hindsight I definitely could\u2019ve made stronger connections than I did. I think that my poor personal statement is behind a lot of my UK decisions, it definitely wasn\u2019t my best work. All good though!\n\n\r  \n**Decisions - All applications were regular decision.**\n\n\r  \n**Acceptances:**\r  \nUniversity of Edinburgh (UK) - conditional offer; must get 39+ on my IB diploma\n\n\r  \nUniversity of Toronto, St. George (Canada) - admitted to Trinity College. Awarded 100k in merit scholarships, as well as priority enrollment for courses and a premium housing award lasting 2 years. Currently waiting to see if I got into a first year Honors program which was recommended to me by the registrar of the college. \n\n\r  \nUniversity of Toronto, Scarborough (Canada) - 110k in scholarships. \n\n\r  \nUniversity of Toronto, Mississauga (Canada) - \\~200k in scholarships. \n\n\r  \nUniversity of Washington, Seattle (USA) - 16.8k Purple/Gold scholarship + admission to Honors college. \n\n\r  \nUniversity of Oregon (USA) - 50k Summit scholarship + admission to Honors college.\n\n\r  \nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder (USA) - 25k Chancellor\u2019s Achievement Scholarship + admission to Honors college.\n\n\r  \nUniversity of Virginia (in-state) (USA)\n\n\r  \nCollege of William and Mary (in-state) (USA)\n\n\r  \nGeorge Mason University (in-state) (USA)\n\n\r  \nAmerican University (USA) - 88k Presidential Scholarship + admission to cornerstone honors/internship program. \n\n\r  \nTufts University\n\n\r  \nNortheastern University - admission to NUin program (1st semester abroad)\n\n\r  \n**Waitlists:**\r  \nBrown University (USA)\n\n\r  \n**Rejections:**\r  \nOxford University (UK) (ouch, kinda saw it coming though)\n\n\r  \nLondon School of Economics (LSE) (UK)\n\n\r  \nUniversity College London (UCL) (UK)\n\n\r  \nHarvard University (USA)\n\n\r  \n**Additional Information:**\r  \nIn the unpredictable world of American college admissions, I feel like I more or less won the lottery. I\u2019m currently torn between **UToronto St. George, UVA, and UWash Seattle**. I\u2019m leaning toward UToronto for the moment - they rank super highly and have given me the offer of all offers. However, UVA is also incredible for politics from what I\u2019ve heard, and it\u2019s \u201caffordable\u201d because of in-state tuition. UWash Seattle let me into their pretty competitive honors college, which would definitely be a leg-up if I went, + they\u2019re fantastic for Environmental Science from what I\u2019ve heard. \n\n\r  \nAny advice on which I should pick? Am I totally missing out on another school from the list that I should be considering? Let me know your thoughts!\r  \n"

        "post": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently a senior in high school who got admitted to CWRU (BME), Northeastern (BioE and Biochem), and UIUC (bioE). I\u2019m currently in a dilemma as to which school to pick (as all of these schools are my top choices), so I just wanted to know what you guys think. My post-college goal is to do medical research where I am using AI to help neurological disorders with medical devices. With scholarships/financial aid, CWRU and UIUC are around 50k, while Northeastern is around 80k.  \nHere are my pros and cons of each school: CWRU Pros: Nice campus. Super close to Cleveland Clinic and University Hospital. It has a lot of good medical opportunities and research. Plus it's the major I wanted the most. Small student body. It also has AI as a minor, and the neuroscience minor is currently being worked on. CWRU Cons: Heard it has grade deflation. Super rigorous course load. The area outside CWRU is really run down. Unsure if I want to live in Ohio next 4 years.  \n NEU Pros: Nice campus. Get to go abroad first semester in Greece or Northern Ireland (unsure yet) and I would be happy with either. A big emphasis is co-ops and study abroad so there will be a lot of opportunities including research opportunities. Sets me up well for post-college jobs. It has a good after-school life. I also got a dual major degree in BioE and Biochem. Has a neuroscience minor.  In the city. NEU Cons: Heard it also has grade deflation. Cost substantially more. Doesn\u2019t have any AI minor.   \nUIUC Pros: Nice Campus. Heavy engineering-focused school. Really good research and internship opportunities. Supportive school. Heard name helps in getting opportunities. UIUC Cons: Super Far from the city. Doesn\u2019t have a big focus on medical stuff. Does not have a neuroscience or AI minor. More CS focused school. A big student body.   \nI\u2019m really confused as to what to pick, so just wanted to know your guys\u2019 thoughts and feedback.  \n"

I also wrote about how I navigated the intersections of race and wealth, growth, and how I\u2019ve learned more about who I am as a person and pushed myself to find myself and leave this state of isolation\u2026 That period was def difficult for the first few years of high school but i got thru it yayyy\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nAmerican University D.C. **RD**\n\nBates College **RD** \n\nSUNY Binghamton **RD** (admit but for a transfer applicant, so enroll in 2025 but in the class of 2028)\n\nSUNY Buffalo **EA**\n\nSUNY Oneonta **EA**\n\nSUNY Potsdam **EA**\n\nSUNY Purchase **EA**\n\nSUNY Stonybrook **EA \u2014> deferred \u2014> admit!**\n\nTemple University **EA**\n\nHampton University **EA**\n\nSeton Hall University **RD** (my mom made me apply because they offered merit & it was a free app lmaoo)\n\n\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\nHoward University **EA\u2014> deferred** bro i was deferred but they still haven\u2019t released decisions\u2026 like WHAT its april 7th\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nThe George Washington University **RD**\n\nUniversity of Southern California **EA \u2014> deferred \u2014> rejected!**\n\nWesleyan University **EDII** in reality i did not want to go here. the app was free because i said i was applying for finaid, and i also only applied because of the opportunity to play volleyball since I had been talking to the coach\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. if your school uses those college websites that calculate your reaches, unlikelies, and etc, **APPLY ANYWAYS!**\n\nI want to say about 65% of my schools were unlikely. only 3 out of the 6 SUNYs i applied for were targets, and those were my state safety schools. bates was my number 1 and it was an unlikely. their acceptance rate is 13.7% and i STILL did that. don\u2019t doubt yourself ever\n\n2. make sure you know where you want to go\u2026 don\u2019t waste your EDI/II\u2026 I didn\u2019t even want to go to Wesleyan fr, and I really did regret not doing EDII to Bates. I had the opportunity to, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 Solidify your choices and make sure you\u2019re doing it for YOU.\n3. SAVE MONEY FOR APPS Most of my apps were free- all of the SUNY\u2019s except for SBU because of SUNY Free App Week, Seton Hall, Wesleyan, and Bates were free. Go to different virtual college events, look into free app periods, etc! They will provide codes or opportunities to get your fees waived! save as much money as you cannnn\n\n^edit, reworded my statement due to confusion "

        "post": "Background: I'm planning to major in biochemistry/chemistry with a potential minor or double major in data science/computer science. My dream has always been to study in a city for undergrad (dream city has always been Manhattan). I value a well-rounded education and want to be surrounded by students who are excited to learn and enjoy intellectual conversations while also having fun. Also, I have my sights set on pursuing a Ph.D. in bioengineering, leaning towards research or biotech, and maybe even academia as a professor. I want a collaborative environment where I can easily double major/minor and explore my interests while maintaining a decently high GPA and being involved in a lot of research. In terms of personality, I\u2019m pretty shy around other ppl so idk take that into consideration.\n\n**Barnard College, Columbia University**  \nPROS:  \n\\- Proximity to Columbia/ivy degree  \n\\- In Manhatten  \n\\- Offers a sisterhood experience with the added perk of not being completely isolated from guys (Columbia boys nearby).  \n\\- Culture: It seems to have a very artsy, creative, hippy culture which I really vibe with   \n\\- Liberal arts college (interdisciplinary, easier to connect with professors and smaller class sizes) while having Columbia to balance out (as an R1 institution)  \n\n\nCONS:  \n\\- haven't received my financial aid package (NPC determines it'll be around 32k/yr (actually more like 22k/yr since I got a 10k/ annual scholarship and I'm getting paid 18k next summer during my internship so it'll be more like 2k-ish for sophomore yr??) (unless I manage to snag 1-2 of the other scholarships I applied to)  \n\\- heard they can be very iffy with aid (offer large amounts one yr and not a lot the next and I don\u2019t want my parents to pay)  \n\\- I'm really introverted and also competing with crazy accomplished ppl so idk how easy it'll be to get research opportunities (especially since I want to go to a top grad program)  \n\\- not very diverse from what I\u2019ve heard  \n\n\n**Howard University**  \nPROS:  \n\\- Black community   \n\\- Got accepted into the KARSH STEM PROGRAM: (More info here: https://karshstemscholars.howard.edu/) (The Complete Package Tuition Scholarship (either 75% or 100% depending on family income), Room + board Books + supplies stipend, Mandatory Summer Bridge Program (incoming freshman), easy access to Research internships (required during summers), Study abroad In-program, Advising, Large & small study groups, Tutoring, Mentoring, Cultural arts, provided support since we\u2019re required to ultimately pursue, a PhD, or a combined MD-PhD) also 90%+ graduates of this program have gone off to ivies/top-20\u2019s for grad school  \n\\- Close to home (could visit family on the weekends)  \n\\- D.C.  \n\\- would be debt-free and save money  \n\\- Really liked the environment/people I met during selection weekend but they represent only a portion of the larger school community so I'm not sure about how well I would fit into the overall school environment  \n\n\nCONS:  \n\\- Black community?? (I love my heritage sm but I've been going to mostly black schools since elementary and I'm interested in experiencing different cultures as well, especially to prepare for life post college)  \n\\- Not as \"prestigious\"  \n\\- Close to home (I\u2019ve always planned to leave Maryland and start fresh in a completely new environment)  \n\n\nThank you!!"

It was such a confidence booster lmao. \n\nCornell: Not evaluative, but the interviewer liked me and my life story. I knew her son too, which was weird. \n\nStanford: It was good, but my weakest one. We talked about AI and developments within the field for a decent chunk of it lmao. \n\n**Essays**\n\nI started my essays REALLY early. I got them reviewed by C2, my English teacher, friends, and my parents. They all thought they were pretty good and highlighted my interests in the interdisciplinary very well.

Ironically enough, even the person who did get in thought I would get in over him lmao. Life is cruel though, especially since Princeton University has been my dream school since I was 12. \n\n**To H4 Kids:** \n\n* I'm sorry you're in this situation. You really can't win here, but you can do your best to hedge all the negative outcomes. If you're interested in STEM (and you better be to get a visa), please apply to Purdue. It's hella affordable for the quality of education that you're receiving. \n* Feel free to look at options outside of the US. Canada has a really good immigration system, but it's rapidly changing. DM me if you want help/information with Canada (keep in mind that I'm choosing to take the risk to stay in the US). \n* Definitely apply to the Need-Blind schools here; you may not get in, but if you get lucky, you're kind of set. \n* Feel free to message me if you want support/guidance/advice I will do my best to help y'all out because lets be real, our situation is so unique that we don't get any help. \n\n**To Everyone Else:** \n\n* Well, it's been real. The journey started with me watching college reaction videos when I was in 7th grade and ended with me being destroyed by all my reaches lmao. \n* I was gutted, I worked super hard for everything. My family didn't help me out aside from basic support with extracurriculars, so I can say that everything I accomplished, I did with my own two hands. But still, it simply wasn't good enough, and I am thinking of changing my mindset and lifestyle because like it or not, grinding and hard work don't pay off. \n* I don't really know what to say rn, I always thought of making this post when I was a junior in high school,  but here I am. Try to craft a narrative the best you can, utilize all the opportunities in your school (and make some new ones for future students!) and try your best. You really can't do anything more than that, aside from be lucky. \n* I'm gonna commit to Purdue University (which I can't be sad about because it is cracked at engineering), but I'll probably go to GT if I get in off the waitlist.  \n   * BTFU!!!

However, I tried my best. \n\nCommon app essay: 8/10, used a metaphor and kept everything very connected to it. I did like what I wrote, but I do know that a lot of people have wrote much better.\n\nCollege specific essays: 6/10, here\u2019s where I think I fell off. With so many colleges and so little time to write creatively for each one individually, I do think my essays began to sound the same.\n\nUC essays: pretty okay I guess, wrote these in like 3 days. 6/10\n\nInterviews: only got one for Princeton. Went really well and I LOVED the woman. She made me feel so comfortable and her and I got along on so many topics.

I do love both of these schools, but it still stings knowing my family had such high expectations for me, and I had such high expectations for myself, yet I ended up letting everyone down. I\u2019ve been having a hard time lately, feeling like maybe all my work was for nothing, even though I love all the schools I\u2019ve been accepted in. It just hurts cause I could\u2019ve had something more if maybe I\u2019d done something different. I know though it\u2019s best not to think this way, so I\u2019m hoping this post just helps me find closure to this whole process. I\u2019m excited for college nonetheless.

It wasn't \"WOW\", but it described me as a kind, helpful, and hard-working person.\n2. Humanities Teacher (7/10 - I would assume. Didn't read). Teachers at my school don't know how to write rec letters since no one applies abroad.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* UPenn: 3/10... First interview. Non-evaluative. The guy was the main interviewer for Canada, so he had 20+ years of interview experience and told me to \"stop feeding him answers\". Ouch.\n* Harvard: 5/10. It was mid. Nothing special.\n* Dartmouth: 9/10. In-person for 1.5 hours. He said he'll try his best to get me in.\n* Princeton: 7/10. In-person for 1.5 hours. Interviewer was 70 years old, but I tried my best to relate to him.\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Common App: Original that I submitted to Yale REA (4/10). It was all over the place and used a really complex metaphor. I rewrote it for RD schools and got feedback from u/ScholarGrade. Got it rated a 8/10-8.5/10 (yes, I am financially irresponsible and did pay for the basic essay rating). No other college counselling... just that one essay rating.\n* Supplementals: Mixed bag. My \"Why Major\" was probably my best essay and would rate it a 9/10. The rest were about girls empowerment, dialogue to bridge polarization, dress codes, photography, etc. I did have some puns and humor here and there.\n\n**Decisions (only the US ones - I'll put my Canadian ones in the add'l info).**\n\n*Acceptances*\n\n* >!Univeristy of Pennsylvania - Wharton School!<\n\n*Waitlists*\n\n* Princeton University\n* Dartmouth College (the interview really made me love the school, but I am still very grateful for the waitlist)\n* Columbia University (applied for aid.

From the \\[EC\\] to \\[EC\\] to the \\[EC\\], you have certainly left your mark on the \\[hometown\\] community. I cannot wait to see how you thrive as a leader and changemaker as you explore Business Economics & Public Policy at Penn!\"*** Yale values collaboration and I am very independent, so that could've been a small factor leading to my REA rejection.\n* **Have a narrative** (at least try. Don't push it). I knew that people applying for my major/school would have lots of business-related extracurriculars about financial literacy. I took a personal route instead and connected everything I did to gender equality in leadership. I alluded to this A LOT in all my essays. I wanted to show that I wouldn't be another finance-bro.\n* **Help others**. After I submitted all my essays, I helped my classmates edit their essays/applications. At one point, I remember thinking \"why am I helping them if they're my competition...\". But I still ended up helping them because relationships are very important to maintain throughout this process. People will remember you for how you made them feel (and not necessarily for your acceptances). Kindness prevails and so does compassion. Be nice in class and in your community - it'll pay off!\n* **Updates**. Sent updates to all my schools about DECA Int'l Qualifier, another local filmmaking win, and progressions in my ECs. Doubt they read this, but I'll just put this here for more context.\n* **Canadian acceptances** *(most are based on GPA, but for the supplemental-based ones, I spoke about the first 2 ECs + DECA):* University of Toronto (Rotman Commerce), York University (Schulich), Queen's University (Commerce), Western University (Social Science), Carleton University (Public Affairs). Ghosted by Western Ivey AEO (result: ??).\n\nObviously, I don't know what got me in, but I really do think my Common App Essay tied everything together. Thanks for reading and good luck to any underclassmen. PM if you have any questions. Go Quakers \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 (potentially... >!if they give me more aid!<)!"

Talked about special family circumstances.\n\n**Reflection/Advice:**\n\n1. The college admissions process can be unpredictable but it isn't random: Your essays, personality, and extracurriculars are extremely important. There are tons of people on this subreddit with extraordinary qualifications that definitely are capable of performing well at a T10 school, but many don't gain admission. My best advice to anyone is focus less on maximizing your awards/ECs and focus more on enjoying what you do. Throughout high school, I've found great enjoyment and fun in all the activities I participate in. Your essays should reflect that you are a genuine person who has a personality outside academics\u2014what do you do for fun?, are you kind to other people around you?, are you curious?, etc.\n2. Don't place so much emphasis on landing a top school: Trust me, there's (most probably) going to be a point where you're getting rejection/waitlist after rejection/waitlist. I was in the same position, but what I came to realize amidst these rejections was that I would've been happy at my state school as well. Your activities shape you as a person\u2014if you're genuinely passionate about them, it doesn't matter whether or not you get into a college because of them, you still gained valuable skills/learned something.\n3. You're probably not going to get into your dream school: My dream school was MIT. My second dream school was Harvard. My third choice was Stanford. I didn't get into my first two choices, and some of the smartest people I know who have far better credentials than I could ever attain (ISEF 1st place winner, Olympiad Qualifiers, RSI, etc.) didn't get into their dream schools. That's completely fine! Like I said before, college admissions is unpredictable, but not random. Before shotgunning or applying to a bunch of schools, remember that there's a high chance you may not get into the school you want to.\n\nI'm going to end this section off with a translated quote from one of my favorite movies of all time (3 Idiots): Don't pursue success; pursue excellence, and success will follow. I think this perfectly encapsulates my experience with college admissions. I've found that the common theme between several HYPSM admits I know is that they didn't care about college admissions until their senior year; instead, they focused on being excellent at what they enjoyed doing. If you do the same, there's a higher chance (although not guaranteed), that you will land one of your top choices.\n\n**If you want help in the admissions process, finding research, or tutoring, feel free to private message me, I'd love to help :)**"

I've always been extremely attentive and they know the perseverant journey I've had in their classes.\n* Teacher 2: we've known each other since middle school since they also supervised a school club I was in. they've supported me at my concerts and know me on a personal level, not to mention that they know how I've persevered and helped others persevere through academic setbacks.\n* Teacher 3: we've academically known each other since middle school. I've always been very attentive and contributive in their classes and got student of the year for one of them.\n* Teacher 4: one of the best people I've ever known. they've supported me at my concerts and know me personally, not to mention that they know that their classes have changed how I view the world.\n* School Counselor: I've developed a very solid connection with them since the beginning of junior year and they're one of the most supportive people to me.\n* External 1 (#2 EC's Research Mentor): I've shown my initiative to always learn from them and be inventive, and they're always interested in hearing about my academics/other ECs.\n* External 2 (Doctor I shadowed): I've always asked questions while shadowing and they always welcome me to closely observe even during some procedures.\n* External 3 (Lead of Organization Collaborating with my initiative, not submitted to CA): could talk about my path to collaborating with their organization, tangible impact we've had on our community together.\n* External 4 (Lead of Organization Collaborating with my initiative, not submitted to CA): could talk about my work in the community and with their org (also huge medical facility in the community), individual anecdotes that are heart-touching.\n* External 5 (Supervisor for #6 EC): could talk about my perseverance in founding/leading, innovative ways to expand club, and my traits that would prep me to become an excellent physician.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* Traditional UG:\n   * Duke (my only traditional UG interview; late-February, virtual): Interviewer was very intrigued by my work, we had some parallels regarding our fields of work and overall goals. I also mentioned something so specific about Duke that brought back lots of nostalgia for them and sparked a mini conversation that made them aware of how I would fit in at Duke (so DO YOUR SCHOOL RESEARCH to a T).\n   * Georgia Tech Stamps (full-ride) SF (Kira Talent; early-February, virtual): I had prepped a lot for this, but my interview did not go very well (super bummed about this but it was completely my fault). However, I have to say that they do a very good job of showing you the infinite opportunities that they offers as a community, including putting you in contact with numerous Scholars/alumni and hosting several info sessions.\n   * Emory Woodruff (full-ride) Finalist (2-part interview):\n      * Kira Talent (early-March, virtual): pretty reasonable and short (\\~30 minutes). same type of content prep as GT Stamps interview, but the practice with the GT Stamps one definitely helped me regarding verbal prep.\n      * Group Interviews (late-March, in-person): very interesting, honestly kinda fun. they mainly test your ability to work on-the-spot WITH OTHER PEOPLE given a certain prompt and discern your natural leadership abilities (not being too overpowering but also never staying silent).\n* Scholarship (can't share too many details on this post due to confidentiality):\n   * Coke Scholar RF Interview (late-January, virtual): very comforting and conversational. I fit into the mindset of the community with ease, and appreciated how much they had read up on me.\n   * Private In-State Scholarship (late-January, virtual): pretty intense interview, but I felt fairly confident about this one. Also appreciated how much they had read up on me, and asked for my opinion on pressing issues statewide.\n* BS/MD (can't share too many details here due to confidentiality):\n   * Creighton \"BS/MD\" (early-February, chose to have it in-person): VERY VERY relaxed. it consisted of 1 med student conversation for \\~20 minutes where they ask about experiences on your application. overall day was also very welcoming/informative, and I really appreciated how much my interviewer had studied my application.\n   * VCU BS/MD (late-February, virtual): very well-rounded experience. MMI was very conversational.\n   * RPI/AMC BS/MD (early-March, virtual): surprisingly not too intense, required the same amount of prep as VCU, started off meh but got better as the interview went on.\n   * Arizona BS/MD (early-March, virtual): very conversational, but slightly disappointed because I couldn't mention a few details that would've made my answers more potent.\n* CASPer Test (late-January): I started prepping 6 days before my test with no game plan whatsoever. I binged youtube videos, did dozens of practice scenarios, memorized the test's format, and nailed down my typing speed, and ended up getting 4th Quartile (highest possible score). In hindsight, many of my peers (who got into other BS/MDs) and I said that taking the CASPer actually helped them prep for their MMIs the most. **PM me if you need tips on how to prep (or cram) for this.**\n* Brown Video Portfolio: very fun to make. got to express the non-academic and non-EC/artsy side of me, show my humor, and be very inventive.\n* **NOTE**: since the beginning of junior year, I've also talked to A LOT of alums/current students at nearly all of the BS/MDs, scholarships, schools, and programs I applied to (LinkedIn is actually useful??). I highly recommend doing this, as they aren't necessarily \"interviews,\" but very informative, nonjudgemental conversations. **PM me for tips regarding this.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\n* context: I started writing 1 week after my junior year APs finished. in total, I wrote 90 essays for UGs and BS/MDs and at least 25 for scholarships.\n* I would say that my essays really differentiated me versus any other component of my application. I'm really proud that I wrote some banger hooks and my essays nailed down themes that were very central to who I am, what change I want to make, my approaches to tasks, and how I want to try new things. tip: don't be afraid to experiment with the format of your essay, as long as it contains a fairly evident, overarching theme. I would advise that each applicant reads [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/s/pFSfYwv9x0) to understand the AO perspective of essays and letters of recommendation.\n* My CA personal statement focused on my journey and reasons for creating EC #1, and incorporated some humor, a very appealing hook, and a cohesive theme that applies to all of life.\n* My BS/MD personal statement focused on a specific, seemingly-unconventional experience that reflected various of my clinical experiences and therefore my motivations to enter medicine. it was a slightly untraditional approach, but it seemed to relatively work with 4 invites from 12 programs (not counting PLME since they don't do interviews).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RESULTS (NOTE: I've also attached my BS/MD decisions as a Sankey diagram to visualize that process better: \\[**[link](https://i.imgur.com/4X9ZGKd.png)**\\])**\n\n* Acceptances:\n   * >!Georgia Tech (EA II w/ Stamps SF, but did not advance to Finalist round post-interview, which I was pretty sad about).!<\n   * >!UNC Chapel Hill (EA w/ Honors Carolina and Accelerated Research Program).!<\n   * >!Emory (RD w/ Woodruff Scholarship Finalist.

I also included my other experiences in research and shadowing and gave brief specifications (which medical speciality, when, how many hours, some specific things I did).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reflection/Advice**\n\nbefore someone comes at me, I did not use ANY familial connections to find/improve my ECs. my #1 strategy is to cold-email, which I've talked about in a past comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wm7f72/comment/ijyg9ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nwriting this post is very emotional. I was one of those kids that began college admissions research WAY too early, meaning I've been HOOKED onto the whole process for an absurd amount of time. as a consequence, I developed a version of \"[duck syndrome](https://psychcentral.com/blog/teens-the-duck-syndrome#signs)\" and couldn't do anything but always compare my activities/accomplishments to others and think that others were effortlessly taking on everything while I just grinded. over time, I've realized that this feeling is EXTREMELY common amongst a majority of competitive applicants. **if you take away one thing from this post, it's to try not to fall into this, as it's extremely unhealthy.** please try not to compare yourself to others, stay away from deep college research until at least middle of sophomore year, and know that there is genuinely no one factor that differentiates \"accepted\" from \"rejected.\" and frankly, that's the unfortunate truth of college admissions: we don't know how many variables exist that AOs factor into their decisions, and that's why admissions is SO RANDOM. for that reason, just continue to refine your own craft, and (this is clich\u00e9 but) \"display the best version of YOURSELF.\"\n\nthis cycle was nothing short of a rollercoaster (for me and others). I've had some (delusional) moments where I thought I would get into most of my schools, but I've had many more moments where I thought I should start preparing for my safety school, because \\_\\_\\_ is lacking in my application (I was fearing that lack of school involvement would be evident, since I've never done DECA/HOSA/FBLA and hold very little involvement in school clubs). there was a point when my fears started coming true: my first 7 legit results were all rejections. in these straining moments, I asked myself is \"What else could I have done?\" at least 10 times per day. **and the answer is nothing.** and I'm extremely grateful that the final results proved to be a balance of all outcomes.\n\nmy motto for the whole year was \"just get through it.\" I pushed through each application with my 100% and didn't settle for any less effort. I GUARANTEE you, if you try as hard as you can to shoot for the stars, you'll land closer to them than if you never tried as hard. it's very possible that you won't see the results immediately, but you will eventually.\n\nmy biggest realization about college admissions: you're applying to an institution to take advantage of their resources/traditions/culture in order to further your own aspirations and catalyze what change you want to make in this world. to optimize this, you have to vibrantly display *what you think* are the most important aspects that define WHO you are, and also what you would use at the institution to actualize those aspirations. after you've tried your hardest to do so, it's up to each program to consider whether you would thrive in their specific environment or not.\n\nultimately, my decision of bs/md vs. LSM comes down to a few things, but is primarily based on how hard I'm willing to work for med school and go through an even more grueling process than these past few months. however, for me personally, I believe that LSM's resources can provide me an experience like literally no other, and also provide me with some flexibility regarding if I still want to pursue medicine or go into consulting first or even another healthcare field. so yes, I'm leaning toward LSM right now.\n\nedit: in fact, I'm still shocked because I, as a non-legacy, ORM, no FGLI, got into WHARTON with 0 economic ECs or classes (I don't think my organization or policy work really count as legit business ECs either). So literally ANYTHING is possible in college admissions. ANYTHING.\n\n**finally, I'm now also launching a consulting program (essays, standardized test prep, internships, initiative building, BS/MD and scholarship interview prep, etc.). this includes some free sessions, but I'm still finalizing this with my team, who are all '24 coke scholars accepted into and attending some of the most prestigious programs nationally and aiming to pursue medicine, biotech, CS, IB/consulting, poli sci, and much more. PM me if you would like more information.**\n\notherwise, also feel free to PM me questions related to my application, experiences, or just admissions in general. also lmk if y'all want me to make another advice post and I will write my heart out. I hope to keep making much more admissions content in the very near future.\n\nthanks for listening to my ted talk :)"

OUT. THE. NOISE. countless people told me I shouldnt apply to any of these schools, that I should go to community college. people I know in real life discouraged me and even people on here did. while they may have been right, you only need one acceptance. I was even discouraged from writing appeals because they \"only accept appeals if theres an error in your app\" ( there was nothing like that for me ).\n\nDont be scared to shoot high. and if you want to attend a school, send over an appeal. the worst they can say is no again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. if youre looking through my post history and you saw the situations with the dual enrollment courses. Im in the clear. They said theyre not gonna rescind me when I emailed and told them my grades\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if you want more details"

It came down to Williams vs. Cornell for me in the end, and even now I still second guess my decision quite a bit.\n\nI was very surprised by my results, especially given that I was applying to business programs with a \"spike\" (?) in law and a lack of leadership positions which I thought was important for business programs in particular. To be fair, it may have been the reason why I was rejected from the rest of my schools. It also seemed like LACs preferred me a lot more over research universities, which was interesting. Overall I'm super happy with my results though! "

Or advice generally, because i've done copious amounts of research, and each school has its perk, Im just at a loss on how to decide.\n\n  \nAlso got accepted too Penn State, UConn, UH, and Other Rutgers Campuses --- Not particularly considering them because (from my research) the other schools listed above are better value all round, I may be wrong -- please point it out if I am.\n\nEdit: Also waitlisted at Wake, UW Mad, Rochester, Fordham -- Im going to treat these as rejections but fingers crossed I get off."

Inspect and understand financial aid offers carefully and be aware of hidden costs, etc.\n\n* Try to do an international or more recognised curriculum if possible.\n\n* Demonstrated interest is VERY important for LACs - please try your best in showing enough interest in colleges you apply to. Do interviews and online sessions with universities wherever possible and take advantage of InitialView if you can.\n\n* Connections and networking with fellow students as well as admissions officers is crucial in this convoluted process for internationals, especially those needing significant aid to attend.\n\n* Try to secure well-structured and written letters of recommendation and counselor reports which expresses you as a student in an academic and a non-academic context, and as an individual.\n\n* Honestly, try to express yourself as a well-rounded put together individual - **and you might just get lucky.** There are no guarantees however, consider your application as rejected when you send them in (something I heard from a senior which I feel is important to stress)\n\n___\n\n**Committed to Georgetown University - Qatar for Fall 2024**\n\n[**Link to full introspection**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UdL-xLBTwdasLhDYO4n3s0lQsfeSswkQ4dIeB1MUjmQ/edit?usp=sharing)"

People around me (other valedictorians) are going to UCLA CSE, Harvard CS, Stanford CS, etc. However, at the end of the day, comparing myself to these people doesn't get me anywhere, and I am absolutely thrilled about GTech. This inherent sense of comparison is natural and I'm sure I'll get over it soon enough though. The reason I would say I am not holistically happy about my college applications process is moreso the fact that I can't stay near home (in good conscious). If I got into SD or LA, I would instantly choose it over GTech due to proximity. However the disparity in ranking between my best instate options (UCI #31 and UCSB #24) to Georgia Tech (#6) is too large to give up cause I'm scared of living without my mommy.\n\nMost of the negative feelings that come with the process went away once I dissociated from external outcomes. Regardless of whether or not I attend a good or bad school, I am still the same person that grew, learned, and developed into a better human being throughout high school. An admissions officer not seeing my capabilities doesn't invalidate those capabilities that I myself am aware of and proud of. I know I'll do great wherever I go, and I'm VERY glad that I did the things I did out genuine interest rather than for the purpose college applications.\n\nThe only advice I would give to people applying in the next few cycles, **PLEASE STRIVE FOR AUTHENTICITY.** If your results don't end up going how you wanted them to go, you will still have experiences, lessons, and a sense of purpose to be happy about. If you do things just to get into college, to pad a resume, and to put on an activties list, you render your personal value to your college applications. Do things because YOU want to them, because YOU care about them, because they are things that will push YOU forward. **Doing this will allow you to create a sense of personal identity beyond your resume rather than vesting that personal identity in the outcome of college admissions.**\n\nAlso, **DON'T SACIFICE YOUR SOCIAL LIFE FOR COLLEGE APPS!** I think this is the thing I am most happy about; I never sacrificed fucking around with my boys and spontaneously doing random shit throughout high school. For me, experiences always came before school (luckily my grades were still good) and they made high school unforgettable. I genuinely enjoyed all of high school because I had a life outside of my classes and extracurriculars. **DO NOT** get obssessed with the idea of acceptance, remember that there is **so much more to life than where you go to college or what your grades look like**. Obviously there is nuance to this argument, don't fail school \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d, but remember that we only get to experience high school once.\n\n**I just want to thank this sub, A2C, and even chanceme for helping me sm throughout highschool!** I am never gonna be seen here again ngl, wish all of you reading this the best \ud83e\udef5\ud83e\udef5\ud83e\udef5\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09"

AP Scholar with Distinction\n5. Drone Robotics Competition National Championship Award\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nHonors Pre Calc and AP Calc AB teacher (10/10): Had her for two years and had a good relationship with her. From what my counselor told me she wrote one of the best letters of recommendation that she has seen in a while.\n\nHonors Algebra II, AP Stats and Mathletes Teacher (9/10): Probably the best teacher relationship I have and again my counselor told me that he wrote a really good letter of recommendation.\n\nAP US History teacher (6/10): Didn't have as good of a relationship with her but she was the best teacher to get for a humanities letter of rec for schools that required one.\n\nDirector of STEP Program at local University (10/10): I have been attending this program since I was in 7th grade and have done a lot with them including spending a lot of time on robotics and volunteering at a lot of events they host. I have a good relationship with the director of the program and she wrote me a really good letter of recommendation that I submitted to schools that took outside or other recommendation letters.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT (10/10): Had probably one of the best interviews for MIT. While it was on the shorter end of around 30 minutes, I was able to connect with my interviewer on the topic of my research. He had a degree in public health and epidemiology so he fully understood my Covid research and stated how I explained it and conducted it was perfect.\n\nHarvard (8/10): It was a virtual meeting so we were unable to make a physical connection but he grew up in a town near mine so we were able to make a connection in that sense. He asked a lot of questions but my responses to them led into a lot of good conversations between us.\n\nPrinceton (7/10): Definition of standard interview. Nothing really special in the interview happened. We had some good conversations but it again ended short at around 30 minutes.\n\nCornell CAAAN (8/10): Idek if this counts as an interview because it was only around 15 minutes and it was just for me to ask questions but it went good because I asked a lot of questions that sparked conversations about Cornell.\n\n**Essays**\n\nMain personal statement was about my journey in STEM and I related it to a quote from a motivational card my grandmother gave me when I was young.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UPenn (RD) \ud83e\udd73\n* Cornell (RD) \ud83e\udd73\n* Binghamton (EA) (Honors College + Presidential)\n* Stony Brook (RD) (Presidential)\n* University at Buffalo (EA)\n* UAlbany (EA)\n* RPI (EA)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Carnegie Mellon (RD)\n* Johns Hopkins (RD)\n* RIT (RD) \ud83d\ude2d\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT (EA Deferred -> Rejection)\n* Harvard (RD)\n* Yale (RD)\n* Princeton (RD)\n* Columbia (RD)\n* Northeastern (RD)\n\nThoughts: Kinda disappointed I wasn't able to land a HYP or MIT but I am really happy that I landed two really solid options. Still conflicted on where I will attend but I am going to visit both schools on their admitted students days and will decide from there. Was kinda stressing out before Ivy day bc I was hit with back to back rejections from Northeastern and MIT and then back to back waitlists from Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon but it all worked out in the end \ud83d\ude0c."

I did very well in her class, and we have a relationship where I can regularly come to her for advice or even just to rant. She knows me the best, even when I don\u2019t always tell her everything I think about. She knows me both academically and personally. Since she knows me the best, I used her letter at every school that accepted Recs.\n* 11th Grade Spanish 4 Teacher: I was so eager to take AP Spanish my senior year, I skipped Spanish 3 entirely and went from 2 -> 4. My teacher knows this and was thrilled to write my letter for me. I got an A in her class both semesters and was a consistent participant and engagement with her and her class. She knows me well academically, and somewhat personally. If a school accepted more than 1 Rec, I submitted hers.\n* 10th-12th Grade Band Teacher: I\u2019ve known my band teacher for the longest and I\u2019ve established a really close relationship with him. It\u2019s become a tradition where I\u2019ll make his baby son some homemade stickers and my teacher has really appreciated it. I\u2019ve also picked up multiple new instruments over my years and learned them to decent skill, which he also touched on. However, he has never written a rec letter and was unsure on how to submit it. I actually don't know if he did submit it, it says he did, but I don't see it on my applications... He knows me mostly personally, since band isn't really an academic class. If a school accepted more than 2 Recs, I submitted his.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n-Ohio State (EA, Psychology)\n\n-Purdue (EA, Psychological Sciences)\n\n-UIUC (EA, Middle Grades Education)\n\n-UC Riverside (Psychology)\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\n-Santa Clara (waitlisted, RD, Psychology)\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n-Johns Hopkins (ED, Psychology)\n\n-UC Irvine (Psychology)\n\n-UC Davis (Psychology)\n\n-UW Seattle (RD, Psychology)\n\n-UCLA (Psychology)\n\n-UC San Diego (Psychology)\n\n-Boston College (RD, Psychology)\n\n-USC (EA, Psychology, deferred -> rejected)\n\n-Boston University (RD, Psychology, did get guaranteed transfer admission though!)\n\n-Northwestern (RD, Psychology)\n\n-Brown (RD, Education Studies)\n\n-UC Berkeley (Psychology)\n\n-UMich (RD, Psychology)\n\n-UMaryland (RD, Psychology)\n\nOverall, I'm honestly sadder about the tragedy in my targets, not so much the genocide that happened with the reaches \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 getting rejected from Santa Clara and UMD made me realize I would've never gotten into OSU, Purdue, and UIUC if I hadn't applied early, and idk how to feel about that- I'm still not really over UW Seattle, I know the acceptance rate went down from 40% to 10% this year, but it still sucks because I feel like EVERYONE around me got into UW, and I want to be part of that 10% too... but I simply am not good enough oh well ! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I am really bummed because UW is such a good school, and it's instate, it would've been a major help for my parents to pay for (and also we don't have to buy exorbitantly priced airplane tickets when i wanna come visit :////). Also something that really makes me sad is all my best friends are juniors rn, and I promised them I'd come to visit them during breaks, come to their last band concert and their graduation, but now I really don't know if I'll be able to, and that guilt is eating away at me. I also feel guilty because my parents paid so much money for my apps and college process, and they encouraged me to reach as far as I want and they were so hopeful. Not to mention the tutors that have helped me over the years and I just feel awful that I only got 4 acceptances out of 19 schools... Idk. As I said before, I know my grades suck ass, and I swear I'm not really sad about the reaches, I'm just sad about my targets (\"targets\").\n\nMoral of the story, DO NOT apply to 29292929 reaches and UW should no longer be considered a target for anyone. Don't place all your eggs in one basket; I was hardcore banking on UW, and that's why the rejection broke me. I'm below average in all aspects and I should've known better \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIt's okay."

While at Amherst I will have to pay 7,100 for the 24-25 year. What is holding me back from William and Mary may sound small, but I have heard very bad things about student happiness and life there. From the food being absolutely terrible to the dorms being terrible. I\u2019ve also heard their students consider the college incredibly boring. I love Amherst, and am going to visit but they also have a very small student population. I haven\u2019t heard nearly as much or any negative thoughts about it but that cold just be explained by proximity. I am on the pre-med track specifically as a Neuroscience major. Which college would be better for my academics, preparation for medical school, wellbeing/happiness? I am looking for a college that is excellent in pre-med/ neurosciences, cares about the wellbeing of their students (including food options), but I do recognize medical school is very expensive and moving out of state is a hassle. I would also like to add that right now the amount that I have to pay at Amherst, is doable. But which school is better academically and socially for pre-med students?"

Got to talk about my passions and pride with heritage and went on tangents about coffee and the history of Ethiopia. Sent me a nice letter in the mail afterwards about it too.\n3. Princeton 8/10: my interviewer was a retired lawyer so even tho i had interests in stem, we went on tangents about public policy, personal experiences with politics and making/connecting with old friends. spoke for 45 min and it naturally felt like 2 friends having a convo. said i had great confidence and good answers! also gave me a lot of suggestions about what to do/explore if i do end up going.\n4. Dartmouth: 8.5/10: interview lasted about an hour and my interviewer was a psych prof at the uni i did research at and was class of 64 from dartmouth. he was surprisingly impressed by my resume and the amount of activities i did as he went through each one on the copy i gave him. talked a lot about my research and the program i started . also got to talk a lot about my heritage and growing up FGLI for part of the interview and he seemed very interested in. asked if ed'd there but hoped i would get in. suggested id be a really good fit given i was interested in environmental studies and looking for tight-knit community.\n5. Cornell: 6/10: nothing too special and significant. my interviewer was on call in his car and basically said that the interview was just supposed to be informational. just explained to me why i should come to cornell and asked if i have any questions about the campus/programs\n6. Essays:\n7. Common App: 9/10 I LOVE MY ESSAY SO MUCH and a lot of people liked it too. talked about niche hobby i had about crushing rocks when i was like 6. connected it to my passions for environmental sci. as well as a cool metaphor for getting closer with my culture.\n8. Supps; 7-8/10: Reused a lot since I applied to 28 schools. Believe they displayed my passions well but some were definite hits and others were somewhat misses because I tend to ramble. Tried to be as creative as possible tho\n9. Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Acceptances**\n2. Howard- EA w/ 20k\n3. Purdue- EA w/ honors+10k\n4.

Because of this program and moving schools after being virtual for COVID, I had credit transferring and scheduling issues which limited my # of APs I could take pretty much all 4 years. Overall, I wanted to still challenge myself over the years so my rigor increased with honors and DE classes while still maintaining my GPA. I also did this b/c I though I was gonna go to my state school anyway\ud83d\udc80. I made sure to explain this in my add. info and had my counselor talk about it in LOR.-I mentioned in my add. info that I'm taking Coursera courses in Calc 1 and Gen chem in my free time since I could not fit them in my schedule. Don't know if that's helpful tho.\n\n**Final Notes**:I am actually glad to end up at OSU. I can continue my research and continue my work with various non-profits as they are local. On top of that, all my college credits will transfer so I'll be able to skip a year of school.  However, I was a little sad about the rejections but not surprised considering my stats and ecs. Fingers crossed I can also get off those two waitlists though.\n\nsorry for the weird formatting\ud83d\ude2d"

He has seen the best of me (in terms of the work I produce and in terms of teamwork/personality/etc). (10/10)\n\n**#2**: 11th Grade English Teacher: Unfortunately some of the schools I applied to needed a STEM and non-STEM letter. I could not ask any of my history teachers (one left and the other is the head of speech and debate and got too many requests for me to ask them). In 11th grade I took two 1 semester English classes (and asked one of those teachers). I did good work and participated in discussions, but I only had the teacher for 1 semester. (\\~6/10).\n\n**Interviews**\n\n**MIT**: A disaster. The interview seemed very focused on my achievements and when I tried to talk about our robotics team\u2019s trip to France and how we were able to preserve and how much we learned, her comment was: so you didn\u2019t win?\n\n**Harvey Mudd**: I think it went okay. He seemed to understand how much my activities meant to me and why I did them, but I feel like it did not really add much to my application.\n\n**UPenn**: Of the 3, it felt the best. I got along great with my interviewer and it felt a lot more like a 2 way conversation than a Q&A session. He seemed genuinely interested in all of my activities and I got a lot more time and freedom to talk about the importance of my non-STEM activities (ex: hiking, TOPSoccer, etc).\n\n**Essays**\n\nI am not a great writer, but I felt like my essays were the best pieces of writing I have produced. I felt like each essay really represented me as a person and showed what mattered to me and why. My common app essay was about our robotics team\u2019s struggles in France and how our expectations and goal of winning was not the most important takeaway from the competition (we got last). Instead it was about learning and the bond of teamwork that comes with working shoulder to shoulder overnight in a hotel lobby trying to fix our robot and how 24 hours after the competition I immediately took what I learned and applied it at COSMOS and the success that resulted from that. My supplementals for most places were usually pretty good except for the diversity essay. For those, I generally turned it on how diverse skill sets are crucial to success using the example of the NYU summer program and our group\u2019s success. For the why major questions I tried to show how I enjoy CS because it enables me to help other people (ex: book exchange, TA, etc). I also had a good topic of my Linear Algebra and the Math behind AI independent study, where even though my school wasn\u2019t going to give me credit, that wasn\u2019t why I was doing it. (Instead it was about learning and enjoying working closely with other students where we each had different focused/desired takeaways but were able to tackle a bigger subject.)\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances**:\n\nSanta Clara University (EA)\n\nPurdue University (EA -> deferred -> accepted)\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder (EA)\n\nUniversity of Oregon (EA/Rolling)\n\nUniversity of New Mexico (EA/Rolling)\n\nSan Diego State University (RD/Rolling)\n\nUniversity of California Santa Cruz (RD)\n\n**Waitlists**:\n\nUniversity of Michigan (EA -> deferred -> waitlisted)\n\nNortheastern University (EA -> deferred -> waitlisted)\n\nUniversity of California Davis (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Irvine (RD)\n\nCarnegie Mellon University (RD)\n\nBoston University (RD)\n\n**Rejections**:\n\nHarvest Mudd College (ED2)\n\nUniversity of California San Diego (RD)\n\nUniversity of Southern California (EA -> deferred -> rejected)\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology (EA -> deferred -> rejected)\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (EA -> deferred -> rejected)\n\nUniversity of Washington (EA)\n\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Los Angeles (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (RD)\n\nColumbia University (RD)\n\nHarvard University (RD)\n\nYale University (RD)\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (RD)\n\nWashington University (St. Louis) (RD)\n\nNew York University (RD)\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nTo quickly expand on my school: generally very academically hard for most people\\* but not really \u201ccompetitive.\u201d People are very willing to work on homework together, cross compile notes, help each other prepare for tests, and many classes are designed with this in mind. In general, most people from my school go to smaller private/liberal arts colleges, but many go to Ivies/HYPSM (both for academics and we have a lot of sports commits, last year was a bit of an outlier but we had \\~14 go for academics). (\\*The first thing most of my friends would say about my school is that it is hard and they get no sleep, but I mostly had a different experience. I was able to keep similar/better grades and activities/sports while going to bed at 10PM and not doing any work past 8/9PM.)\n\nTo expand on the rankings: I know I am at least in the top 20% and from comparing grades with others, I am at the top of the group behind the people who have a 4.0 UW.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nI knew from the start that my college results would not define the rest of my life and where I applied/wanted to go would not be based on name/prestige/ranking. I genuinely love school and I do the activities/etc that I do because I actually enjoy them (both are significantly different to a lot of my friends) and I know that wherever I go, I know I will do great. Also I knew that:\n\n* Comparison is the thief of joy: I would not compare my results to anyone else's or feel bad that the school I end up getting into is ranked X while someone else gets into a school ranked X - 1\n* I also would take each rejection in a personal way: If I was rejected, it was a sign that I would not be happy there. It would be likely some combination of the academics would be too hard or the fit was not good.\n\nHowever, despite knowing all this, I still feel generally unhappy with my results. By far, of the 30 places I applied to, UCSD and Harvey Mudd were my top 2 choices. While obviously I would have been very happy if I got into any of the reach schools I applied to (Ivies, UC Berkeley, CalTech, UW Georgia Tech, etc), I feel like I did not fully consider the fact that I would not end up at UCSD or Harvey Mudd. I liked my school college counselor (even if she was mostly an echo chamber instead of guiding advice), but I feel like she very heavily implied that I had very good chances at UCSD and Harvey Mudd and said my essays were the best she had ever read and was very surprised when I told her my results.\n\nAlso, in spite of what I said earlier, it is hard not feeling the pressures of not going to a very very very highly ranked/prestigious school. It doesn\u2019t help that my friends are going to Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Cornell, UMich, Harvard, Yale, and Berkeley mostly for CS/STEM and my parents and 7 of their cousins went to Berkeley. I think these feelings are not necessarily: \u201cX got into a higher rank than me,\u201d but more on the lines of: \u201cX is going somewhere they wanted to go\u201d and there is that open question of if I did get in to one of those, would I be happier because at least the fact that it is very very very very highly ranked makes up for my lack of excitement. Again, contrary to what I said earlier, I did end up applying to almost all of the top ranked schools in the US. However, I think there is also the question of (at least from my parents) if I applied and happened to get lucky at some of the other top schools I didn\u2019t apply to (Cornell, Dartmouth, etc)\\* as some of my friends got in despite getting into no UCs. (\\*Parents consoled against those 2 especially initially; Cornell: people are depressed there and the weather is bad and Dartmouth: \u201cworst of the Ivies\u201d.)\n\nI think my only 3 regrets of high school were:\n\n* Not skipping a math level when I had the option to;\n* Not spending more time looking into/visiting colleges before picking which ones I wanted to apply to (or maybe not \"shotgunning\" harder because I had more than enough time/energy to submit more applications that had good quality);\n* And not retaking the ACT. On practice tests, I had been getting close to perfect in all 4 sections but on the actual test I missed like 12 questions on the math section which was usually my strongest. (Also parents really wanted a 36 overall.)\n\nOverall, writing this has been mostly therapeutic and helped me (sort of) organize why I am still a little unhappy. I would like to finish by again saying: my parents are very supportive of whatever decision I make and not openly sad/disappointed/angry and I know that I will do great and I am not worried (just unhappy that I might end up where it snows\u2026)."

She makes us fill out a form, so if someone would like to see what I wrote, I am willing to show that. I'd estimate a 7.5/10, based on her alacrity.\n\n**AP Calculus BC Teacher:** Also writes recommendation letters for many students. While she's undoubtedly very nice to everyone she saw my genuine interest in Calculus and math in general, along with my willingness to constantly challenge myself. I could tell she believed in me. 8.5/10.\n\n**App Mentor:** I found out very late about selective research programs, opportunities, and competitions. Over the summer I did research on what things I could possibly add to my application, and I found Polygence. I was matched with a PhD Statistics candidate from Stanford, and he oversaw/guided me throughout the creation of my app. He always spoke about how well I was doing, especially with time and motivation. He also commented that I am one of the few clients he has had who has an idea and is able to implement it. I would estimate a 9/10. This score could go down though if the officers did their research and found that he is in Polygence.\n\n# Interviews\n\n**MIT:** I definitely connected with my interviewer. He was a nuclear physicist, and though I was applying for computer science, our meeting extended from 30 to about 90 minutes through discussion of physics and chemistry, which I am decently knowledgeable about. I definitely think he enjoyed speaking with me, also finding solidarity in that we were both African American. 9/10.\n\n**University of Pennsylvania:** My interviewer was impressed mainly with my first extracurricular because of its sheer size and time commitment. I was able to send him my portfolio and he took a glance at it and said he liked it. The rest of the interview felt pretty standard. 8/10.\n\n**Harvard:** Similar to the Penn interview she was mainly surprised by the time commitment of my first extracurricular. Again, pretty standard interview. 8/10.\n\n**Princeton:** This interview probably went the worst. It was definitely still a good interview, there were just no points where I felt that my interviewer saw me as a valuable applicant. My interviewer also stressed a diversity point to me, which felt a little weird. I imagine her intentions were good, I just felt that any element of racial diversity should be something that is evident to me\u2014I shouldn't have a white person telling me about it. 7.5/10.\n\n**Stanford:** I didn't even know they did interviews until checking this subreddit after Ivy Day.\n\n# Essays\n\n**Common App Essay (GPT Summary):** The author reflects on their journey of attempting to challenge the beliefs of others, only to find that logic and reasoning often fail to sway deeply held convictions. They realize the importance of active listening and understanding the underlying perspectives and experiences of others. They emphasize the necessity of communication for societal progress and advocate for respectful dialogue as a means of bridging divides and fostering understanding. Ultimately, they stress the importance of engaging in conversation, even in the face of resistance, as a pathway toward collective growth and enlightenment.\n\nI worked for around a month on my essays for T5s. Everything below that only had one question which I answered by copy and pasting my other essays. I would say that all of my responses came from my heart. I lied in none of them. I hoped that I would convey my passions and aspirations. I thought I did.\n\n# Early Action:\n\n**Massachusetts Institute of Technology:** Deferred\n\n# Regular Decision:\n\n**William and Mary:** Accepted + Monroe Scholar\n\n**Franklin & Marshall:** Accepted\n\n**University of Virginia:** Waitlisted\n\n**Carnegie Mellon:** Waitlisted\n\n**Williams:** Waitlisted\n\n**Johns Hopkins:** Accepted\n\n**Princeton:** Rejected\n\n**University of Pennsylvania:** Rejected\n\n**Massachusetts Institute of Technology:** Rejected\n\n**Stanford:** Rejected\n\n**California Institute of Technology:** Rejected\n\n**Harvard:** Rejected\n\n# Guidance request:\n\nLooking at different applications for Computer Science to various schools, I can look at my application and think \"it only makes sense that I would get rejected.\" At the same time though, I often see applications (especially during MIT EA) for Computer Science with few extracurriculars, which are not even in Computer Science, gaining acceptance.\n\nI understand that I have a gift. I never studied for any standardized test (except AP World History) and managed to get top scores. Watching interviews and interacting with people who've gone to T5's has never made me feel lesser-than. It's always felt very easy to spot unrealistic generalizations or equivocations in their arguments. The same goes for T5 admits from my school.\n\nIn that sense, I feel that not gaining admission to a T5 is a negative reflection on me as a person. That I have such a gift but am not able to apply it even though people with less can. I'm struggling to not feel angry and admissions officers and myself. I did the things I loved. My top extracurricular consisted of working 12-hour days, along with research, and endless troubleshooting. And with all due respect, none of the people who were admitted to a school of my selectivity or higher in my grade had an activity which required that unwavering tenacity over a four year period. I taught myself everything I know about programming. I had begun studying Calculus in 8th grade.\n\nSimultaneously, however, I understand that my method of displaying competence is not traditional. It received no awards, no placements, and I was only able to send a portfolio to CalTech, MIT, and Harvard.\n\nI poured my heart into activities which required all of my gifts and mental health and I got the same rewards as other people who (I have not asked them all of the extracurriculars) seem to have done much less.\n\nI also feel that I lacked a lot of opportunity. I've been a reticent person ever since 9th grade and that was around the time I developed what is (likely) social anxiety disorder. I didn't know about math competitions and their importance or about research. And even if I did, I would have assumed that creativity, passion, and innovation would be much more valuable than scoring well on a study-able and trite series of questions.\n\nBecause of my disorder, the size of my school, and being uncomfortable with public transportation I also never got to participate with other people on some of my skills\u2014playing piano, singing, or running. I am quite confident that if I had gone to a STEM school with a larger class size, I would have participated in more things because I would have known about them. I think I would probably have been accepted to 2+ T5 schools.\n\nThough I feel underestimated, I also feel very lucky to be accepted to Johns Hopkins University. I think there's some bias for where I live, but in a room of 100 applicants, I am one of the only 7 who get accepted. I like to think that when I change the class size for Hopkins to match that of MIT, the acceptance rate is approximately identical. A little critical thought easily disproves that the selectivity (controlling for major) is anywhere similar, though.\n\nLooking forward, I'm split between Hopkins and Mellon. If Mellon accepts me from their waitlist I will probably go since they are among the top in Computer Science degrees. I am also considering studying Philosophy, however, so I may be motivated to submit transfer applications to schools which are renowned for those two programs (Princeton, Harvard, Stanford).\n\nI'm also concerned about people. I imagined that getting into a T5 would allow me to finally be in an environment where every person has a deep passion, along with proof of it. I imagined learning about various disciplines and discussing salient topics with people who are knowledgeable about them. I've watched many videos about top colleges and am often feel disapprobation when I hear about elitism or people being in it just for the degree. I can only imagine, however, that these people are everywhere, and the highest concentration of truly passionate people are at the top.\n\nSo I'm not sure what to feel or what to do. I definitely plan on doing a lot more during my freshman year, but even if I plan to transfer, I know the acceptance rates are effetely low. It feels like I wasted my shot.\n\nThat about covers my rant. Maybe I'm stupid, arrogant, and naive. Maybe there's some validity in how I feel. If you've gotten this far, thank you. I'm extremely grateful for any response to this post."

I graduated from the program the summer of my junior year.\n\n3) Linguistics club president! Member sophomore and junior year and then ran it senior year. Super fun club to geek out about languages :)\n\n4) NSLI-Y virtual Turkish program. Somewhat selective US State Department program to learn critical languages for US foreign policy. I recommend this a million times over to anyone who loves foreign languages - 10 week course and I even got some Turkish sweets sent in the mail.\n\n5) Part-time job at tutoring company. Pretty standard high school job that I held for most of junior and senior year.\n\n6) English teacher at a sleep-away camp in Spain! Two week camp where I was one of the camp counselors in charge of the English learning activities. A lot of fun but definitely a test to how easily I can handle loud 5-11 year olds for hours at a time...\n\n7) Native American language revitalization project! I was an intern at a Native American org and worked on documentation research for Apache and Lakota language families and even helped compile a children\u2019s book in Lakota!\n\n8) GeoBee organizer for my town's middle school. Covid led NatGeo to shut down their GeoBee which was a huge bummer because I loved that so much growing up, so a few friends and I decided to set up the geo bee at our school again and as a geography lover it was a lot of fun \n\n9) Warehouse associate! I worked as a warehouse associate over the summer after my junior year which was definitely interesting and I learned a lot about packaging/deliveries/returns/shipping.\n\n10) Varsity track and field. I ran track in the summer and did sprinting and jumping events. I wasn't too crazy at it but I decided at the last minute to cram it on this list!\n\n**Awards:**\n\n1) Congratulatory citation from my state's Congress. Signed by governor + a few state reps and it was awarded due to my first place selection in an essay contest that led to a 3k donation to org in EC#1 on my behalf!\n\n2) Certificate of completion of course in EC#2 along with a CEFR C1 distinction in Spanish (awarded due to same course)\n\n3) Volunteer award from town volunteer foundation for work with EC#1 org. One youth recipient per year.\n\n4) Seal of biliteracy in Spanish + French as well as NSLIY certificate of completion for Turkish course.\n\n5) English department award + book award (both from school)\n\n**Interviews:**\n\n*Honestly don't feel like elaborating on these so I'll give each one a quick score. I can respond to comments if anyone is curious about a specific one listed.*\n\nPrinceton - 9/10\n\nYale - 7/10\n\nHarvard - 7/10\n\nDuke - 6/10\n\nWashU Scholars - 8/10\n\nEmory Scholars - 8/10\n\n**Letters of Rec (*****if I had to guess my strongest section*****)**\n\nAP Spanish 10/10 - We were super close, I would talk with her a lot inside and outside of class, and on last day of class she hugged me and told me I was her favorite student she's ever had and one of the reasons she is so happy she became a teacher. She then emailed my mom like a three paragraph long note that made her start crying. If I had to guess, I'd imagine that the letter talked about my independent study in Spanish Lit, love for languages, and personal attributes.\n\nAP English 9/10 - She loved me and I was really good at her class. I was one of two students out of 40+ she had that she gave an award to and I would often conference with her. I would imagine that she wrote about the ELL inequality research paper I conducted in her class, other minor writing assignments, and my general academic strength.\n\nCEO of immigration center in EC#1 10/10 - I don't think additional reccs are always worth it but I think in my situation this one helped a ton. She likely spoke about me becoming the youngest ELL director the organization has seen, the work I had done with this organization, and especially about one of the ELL students I had been working with for over 4 years now and had helped through a lot of pretty major life situations. I think this gave a great deal of context about the impact of EC#1 that couldn't be conveyed with 150 characters.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI think my essays were strong but this is ultimately quite a subjective section.\n\nCommonApp: I wrote my CommonApp about my complicated relationship with Spanish growing up and how I ultimately went from seeing language as a skill that needed to be perfected to a gateway into connection and community.\n\nSupplements: I absolutely despised writing my PS but loved supplements. Topics included homonyms, pigeon vs. paloma, and my grandmother cooking a cat.\n\n**Decisions!!**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nYale (Defer REA --> Accepted!)\n\nPrinceton\n\nBrown\n\nJohns Hopkins (Hodson Trust Scholarship 55k/yr!!) \u2014> *Committed!!*\n\nDuke\n\nWashU (Ervin full tuition scholarship!!)\n\nEmory (accepted to Atlanta, Woodruff full ride scholarship through Oxford campus!!)\n\nRice (Trustee Scholarship 20k/yr!)\n\nCase Western Reserve University (Nord Scholar + 45.5k/yr scholarship!!)\n\nWilliams \n\nAmherst\n\nUniversity of Rochester (25k/yr!)\n\nTrinity (Global Health Gateway, research scholarship)\n\nWilliam&Mary (Monroe research scholar)\n\nDuke Kunshan (in China, half tuition scholarship!) \n\nBoston College\n\nFordham (full tuition Fordham University scholarship!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\nVanderbilt (didn't accept spot)\n\nNortheastern (no)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nHarvard\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Parting thoughts + special opportunity for rising seniors!!**\n\nI am so so grateful for how this process went but it will be a very challenging choice. Going into the process, merit aid I knew would be a big factor because my family is full pay on paper but 90k/yr isn't exactly affordable. Right now I'd say my main four are Johns Hopkins, WashU, Emory, and Yale, and this month is going to be super difficult in regards to making the final selection...\n\nI also really benefitted from all the resources on both this subreddit and A2C throughout high school and looking back I kind of enjoyed this whole process. If any juniors are interested in having me guide them through this process **for free**, I am accepting PMs and will likely work with 10 throughout the application cycle. I will close this offer May 1st. \n\n&#x200B;"

Basically was a cashier for a mobile bar vendor at seasonal events. Not too many hours\n4. Boy Scouts. Earned Eagle rank, 42 camping nights and 87 service hours, positions as chaplains aide and assistant senior patrol leader, built four benches for police department and raised 500 lbs of food. \n5.

We also did the NHD program together and I excelled in his classes. I did get caught giving a friend my essay to copy, but he said he moved on from that.\n\nChem + Lab Assistant Teacher: Also close to her. I went from having a B- in her class first semester to an A second semester. She probably rushed writing my recommendation though as she had a young child and I asked kinda late.\n\nCollege Counselor: Met for the first time the start of my senior year. Seemed nice enough, never really did much with her though. \n\nInterviews\n\nMIT: (5/10) I was able to highlight some good things in my profile but also struggled under some questions. Failed to feel like a conversation. \n\nEssays\n\nLooking back at things my essays were pretty low quality. My writing just comes off as very bland. I wrote about traveling across 46 states and 3 countries for my common app essay. A lot of my supplements talked about lessons from building a houseboat with my grandpa, my rock collection, or my bond with my dad over cooking. There were a few others I used too.

I\u2019m also disappointed in my schools college counseling program. I had 3 different counselors over my time and was let down by a school that claimed to be college prep. Right now I\u2019m stuck between acg engineering at state, petrol engineering at Texas or chemistry at UNC. I might also try to transfer next year. Or try for a T10 for grad school if I do go into patent law."

life if Bucknell accepts me off the waitlist before decision day that will just make my decision so much more difficult I will go to the accepted students days for Binghamton and Rutgers and that will

The reason for this is that my parents put one word extracurriculars e.g. \"Squash,\" instead of explaining it in detail last year. This year, I put down my extracurriculars and mentioned some that my parents didn't mention last year, which I think led to me being rejected. For example, I said that I have been doing competition math for 3 years but last year my application didn't have competition math on it.\n\nI am not exactly surprised about the Exeter decision either, considering my essays. I am, however, a bit surprised about my Riverdale decision because it was easily my strongest application and the least competitive school. Ig different schools take different people, or im just bad.\n\nI'm completely fine with going to my current public school, however am a tiny bit regretful for not applying to more schools."

Before high school, I grew up in California, if that makes a difference. Plus this post is a year late which means I was part of the 2022-2023 application cycle, not the current 2023-2024 application cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAt the end of the day, I was the (below?) average Asian male CS applicant with a competitive academic record but a relatively unremarkable extracurricular profile, with nothing \u201cnew\u201d to offer. While my application had its strengths, it lacked the compelling narrative or unique hook that top-tier institutions often seek. Nevertheless, my college applications strategy revolved around shotgunning a myriad of schools in hopes that my good fortune would get me into one good school; however, my hopes did not come to fruition, which is disappointing as it means I could stopped my applications during the early cycle with the exact same results and have avoided the costs of over a thousand dollars, dozens to hundreds of hours of invested time, and false hopes. I recognize that my in-state status likely played a significant role in my acceptance to UNC Chapel Hill, as I was rejected or waitlisted by many of my reach schools.\n\nLooking back, I regret not seizing opportunities to explore my passions and engage in more meaningful extracurricular pursuits. There are an innumerable number of these pursuits that I find out about on a daily basis to have regretfully missed. The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly disrupted many aspects of my high school experience, but I cannot help but feel that I used it as an excuse to coast. In addition to having my freshman year cut short by the pandemic and my sophomore year fully virtual, I was offered the option to remain virtual for my junior year, which I regretfully accepted. Until my mom attended a college applications webinar in the spring of my junior year, I was blissfully ignorant of everything happening around me, at which point it was too late to change.\n\nAs this post is a year late, I can tack on a short reflection of my first year at UNC Chapel Hill. I have innumerable gripes with the institution and its policies (if I start explaining those, they will go on forever); however, I am still grateful for effectively being granted a \u201csecond chance\u201d. I fully recognize that in my situation, I could have suffered infinitely worse outcomes; I am fortunate enough to have a strong state school with enough opportunities and resources to not have limited my future options. I have met a number of great people over the past year and hope to make the most of the opportunities I have to secure a bright future for myself.\n\nP.S. if you\u2019re reading this and you know who I am, I would appreciate it if you do not dox me :)"

I wasn't accepted into any of my reach schools, and the lack of targets didn't help. However, I did manage to get into Purdue, UMN Twin Cities, and RIT \u2013 all of which have amazing BME programs. Now, I'm feeling confused about where to go because the costs are basically the same for all of them, and each has its own benefits. I'm currently leaning towards ASU and Purdue as my top two choices. Let's see where I end up. Sidenote: As far I can i see I have the lowest SAT score for people who got into Purdue Engineering, i feel bad for all those people with 1550s getting rejected but oh well. Guys help me decide where to go ASU has a great climate and having to worry about snow is amazing and ASU's tie-up with KCL for BME looks cool plus unlike Purdue they don't have  First-year general engineering then admit to your major bs which means I get to study my major and uni can't take that away from me unless I fuckup bigtime since I can't spend over 150k USD for my study Purdue zero financial aid for Internations is also hella concerning but I like Purdue as well so it's been a pain to decide.   \nMy advice to anyone going through this process is to stay human and focus on your grades  \n"

Teachers definitely like me but I didn't have a super special relationship with any of them.\n\n**Essays**  \nI genuinely don't know what the hell makes a good essay a this point. If I really had to rate them, I would say they were fine but probably nothing crazy or really special. Maybe 7.5/10?  \nI think that my RD essays (even thought I wrote all of them over winter break lol) were decent, since I had a much clearer view of what I wanted to do in college and what I was interested in. I talked a lot about psychology, philosophy, how I'm interested in the ethics of engineering, etc., and I think I had a pretty good \"community\" essay. They might have been good but obviously not good enough to get me any crazy results lol.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\nUMD\n\nUT Dallas\n\nUNC\n\nUMass\n\nPurdue\n\nNC State\n\nEmory\n\n**Rejections:**\n\nPenn (ED)\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nUIUC\n\nBrown\n\nVanderbilt\n\nNorthwestern\n\nCornell\n\nUChicago (ED2)\n\nMIT\n\nHarvey Mudd\n\nUSC\n\nUMich (deferred and then didn't even submit a LOCI, so this was expected)\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\nWashU\n\nCMU (lol)\n\n**Additional Information:**  \nPretty much deciding between Emory and UNC at this point. Purdue would be a decent option but not sure it's worth it for the cost (they didn't give me any money). Considering how mid my ECs were (I put almost no effort into \"building a profile\" for colleges during high school), I think I did pretty well.\n\nI'd really appreciate any thought/advice. I've planned on doing CS but I'm very open to other areas of study (business, econ, data science, philosophy, etc.), especially since I didn't really get into any top CS schools. How do UNC and Emory compare in terms of opportunities and job prospects for data science and business, or going to law school or getting a masters? Is Purdue good enough in CS that it would be worth going there instead?\n\nI'm going to visit Emory and see how I like it, but it does seem pretty nice so far. I'd like to get out of NC and Atlanta is a great city without being insanely far. My only concern is that Emory is super medicine-focused and I might be out of place there. Also I'd be missing out on UNC's sports, although I'd probably appreciate the more academic vibe at Emory.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading and good luck to everyone else out there on the college journey!! It's often very confusing and exhausting but hopefully we will all end up somewhere we enjoy."

Although I wouldn't count that as an excuse.  \n***Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)***  \n***Acceptances:***  \nRose Hulman (27k aid per year)  \nGeorgia state (out of state tuition waiver)  \n***Waitlists:***  \nTrinity College  \nCaltech  \n***Rejections:***  \nUofPenn (Wharton) - deferred from ED then rejected  \nCornell  \nDartmouth  \nYale  \nDuke  \nHamilton  \nNorthwestern  \nSewanee (never got my decision)  \nTufts  \n\n* ***Additional information***  \n**#1**In the additional information section, I had put in my AIME, AMC, and other international/national math exams that I gave.  \n**#2**I had explained my dad's conditions that he was suffering from cancer and it was a reason why I took a gap.  \n**#3**I also explained why I was test optional and also attached links to the emails that verified that the ACT cancellation was not because of me. I tried to give the ACT twice. Once it got cancelled due to the G20 summit. The other time server issues.  \n\n* ***Verdict***  \nMy essays weren't up to the standards. I'll probably try for a good grad school. I am all to blame for even though I had being seeing a therapist and all the issues regarding my dad's cancer.  \n"

Minecraft Server Owner and Developer: Ran Minecraft Servers. Accumulated 25,000+ unique players across all servers and was peaking 80 players online at a time. Managed staff teams of up to 20 members, developed custom game modes using Skript and eventually Java, created virtual webstores for funding (didn't report revenue because it wasn't much - most came from one really P2W server in a short span - made almost $1,000 in a couple weeks).\n2. Paid Fortune 500 Software Internship: Worked at a local company as a software engineer. Worked full-time during the summer (40h/w) and now part-time during the school year (10-20h/w).\n3. Computer Science Club President: Mainly pushed competitive programming and local competitions to students. Hosted sessions in the morning for students to prepare for upcoming contests. Also did other various club activities, such as game nights and working on a school app.\n4. Tennis Team Captain: I was pretty trash not gonna lie (peaked UTR 5.5), but I really enjoyed playing and spent a lot of time on this. Started my freshman year, and improved a decent amount for how late I started. Got to varsity as a sophomore, and played at the conference tournament for my team my Junior and Senior years. Won some school awards too.\n5. Minehut Hackathon: Led one of my servers to win a competition hosted by the server host I use. Coded a pretty cool Wipeout obstacle course game mode and composed some custom note block music to go along with it too. Listed as an activity because I spent a couple months working on it.\n6. Quiz Bowl Team Captain: Been doing Quiz Bowl since 4th grade. Made state finals my sophomore year, and was an all-star player last year and this year. Just a fun thing I enjoy.\n7. Mu Alpha Theta President: For most of my high school years, this club did absolutely nothing (I kept losing the election, finally got President as a senior), but this year I made it my goal to turn it into an actual math club. Got my school signed up for some invitational competitions, and we also got signed up last minute to proctor AMC for the first time in at least a decade (was 1q away from AIME only having a weekend of prep, so sad). Also did some tutoring through this + paired tutors with students.\n8. SAT Math Bootcamp Tutor: Invited by schoolhouse.world to host an online bootcamp. Was a pretty cool opportunity, I tutored 12 students in 8 75m sessions spread across 4 weeks.\n9. Worked another part-time job: Worked for a local startup for a few hours per week, more in the summer. Didn't do anything too significant, mainly manufacturing. Started freshman summer, quit when I got my SE internship.\n10. Band: Did this my freshman year. Made All-Region Band and Orchestra 2nd chair. Quit because I severely disliked marching band specifically and didn't have much room in my schedule.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. Local Coding Competition related award\n2. National Merit Semifinalist\n3. National Honor Society\n4. USACO Silver - Did this for the first time for fun this past December and decided to add it because I didn't have anything better. During EA had AP Scholar with Distinction instead \ud83d\udc80\n5. Honor Roll Type Award \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\n* Also ended up winning 3 local coding / math competitions recently, and sent that information to schools in which there was ample time for it to be read.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nAP Calculus Teacher - Main recommendation #1. Had her for Calculus AB and BC, she sponsors Mu Alpha Theta, and I am TAing for her. Could speak well to my abilities as a student and is my favorite teacher I had in high school. Ranked me in the top 2 most brilliant students she has ever taught. I would guess 8-9/10.\n\nAP Computer Science Teacher - Main recommendation #2. Had him for Programming 1 and AP Computer Science A. Knew this teacher pretty well and had been on trips with him for coding competitions. Also sponsors the Computer Science Club (as expected), and knows about all of the things I am doing with that. Could speak well to my programming abilities and other characteristics. Also one of my favorite teachers and would guess 8-9/10.\n\n10th grade English Teacher - Used her recommendation for MIT and uploaded it for a couple other schools too that took more letters. Was my favorite humanities teacher and could speak to my personal characteristics + writing abilities. I believe she also liked me a lot too, and I have no idea what she wrote about, but would guess 7.5-8.5/10.\n\nI had a couple other supplemental letters of recommendation, including one from a director at my internship and one from a former director of advanced programs in our district, but I had a hard time picking between which ones to use and switched back and forth for certain schools. Would guess the letter from my internship was extremely important for Turing.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nHarvard - Really cool and super cracked guy. Gave me a lot of advice and I learned a lot from talking to him. I was able to emphasize my passion for STEM and talk about everything I wanted to. 8/10\n\nMIT - Also a great conversation. Didn't come from my region, but related to her a lot and was able to talk about everything I wanted to. 7/10\n\nPrinceton - Was a nice conversation and learned a lot about the school. Didn't get to talk about myself and my activities much, but nothing went wrong either, just pretty average. 6/10\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nPersonal Statement - Wrote about a challenge I faced while working on my Minecraft Servers (online bullying \ud83d\udc80). Thought this essay gave great insight into my role as a server owner and the interpersonal skills I gained along with the hard skills (coding). Also showed how I grew from Minecraft to doing more with computer science and how it helped me find my passion for programming. 7.5/10\n\nEA Supplements - Quality varied here. Was meh for most schools, worse for ones I didn't care about as much. Looking back on these I could have improved them a lot. 6.5/10\n\nRD Supplements - I am not a naturally gifted writer, but I poured so much time and effort into these essays - particularly MIT and Stanford. Thought I did a good job of showcasing my personality, interests, and passions. 8.5/10\n\nThe trend I noticed is the more effort I put into my essays, the worse I did. Maybe because I was too nerdy (can't help it), or could have just been a coincidence.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Some safeties with NM scholarships\n* NC State (EA)\n* Virginia Tech (EA)\n* Umass Amherst (EA)\n* Purdue (EA)\n* Georgia Tech (EA)\n* UT Austin Turing (EA) (committed!)\n* Rice (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Columbia (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT (RD) - Ouch, expected but still hurt\n* Stanford (RD)\n* Harvard (RD)\n* Princeton (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nMade a maker portfolio for MIT showcasing my servers and some code. I thought the video was pretty cool, but don't have it uploaded anywhere.\n\n**Final Reflections:**\n\nBefore applications started, I thought I was screwed because of a lack of awards + not knowing about olympiads. Then I had a perfect EA and way overestimated my chances in RD, which overall was pretty disappointing (besides Rice).\n\nDoesn't matter though because I survived the CS bloodbath and landed one of my top three choices (Turing)! Still shocked I got in there of all places, I thought that would be the most difficult one for me to get as I don't have any great awards or anything crazy going for me. I guess they really saw my passion for coding and STEM in general through my activities + underrepresented state probably played a huge role. I realize now I was too boring/common of an applicant for my RD schools though. Even owning Minecraft servers couldn't save me, I am too much of a typical nerd (I wrote about my playlist of Calculus parodies and my blackpenredpen merch \ud83d\udc80).\n\nWhile I am disappointed that all the work I put into writing my essays RD didn't reap many rewards, I am extremely happy with my overall results - I probably only would have picked MIT or Stanford over Turing. I would have loved to have known about some opportunities such as olympiads early on throughout high school, as I find them really fun, but I wouldn't change anything about the things I ended up doing. I just followed my passions and did what I wanted to, and it all worked out in the end.\n\nHook 'Em!"

USACO Gold\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nMath Teacher - 8/10. Knew teacher well and was consistently a top student.\n\nEnglish Teacher - 7/10. Strong student and talked to teacher a decent amount.\n\nProfessor from #1 EC - 8/10. Worked extensively with the professor regarding my research.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT - 10/10, clicked with the interviewer really well and we talked about a lot of the non-academic side of my app(sports, scouting and music).\n\nDartmouth - 8/10, pretty standard interview and was able to connect regarding our passion for research.\n\nPrinceton - 8/10, interviewer was a student-athlete too so we had a solid conversation about time management.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\nI submitted a music portfolio of 3 oboe pieces. Overall, the portfolio came out pretty well, and my private lesson teacher said it was strong.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement  - 7.5/10. I struggled to find a topic that resonated with me but ended up writing about overcoming health issues with extracurricular activities + the community I found in these activities. Those who read the essay said it was strong and told a great story.\n\nSupps - 7/10. A lot of the supps were rushed and didn't have much personality to it. I felt as if they were generic and on the safer side.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* Purdue\n* UC Santa Barbara w/ Regents\n* UC Irvine\n* UC Davis\n* TAMU Engineering\n* UTD\n\nWaitlists (i got so many i lost count at a certain point):\n\n* UMich\n* Gtech\n* Harvey Mudd\n* UCLA\n* Cornell\n* Columbia\n* Dartmouth\n* CMU\n* MIT (Really surprised by this one, thought I was auto-reject)\n\nRejections:\n\n* UCSD (Accepted to college but rejected for 1st + 2nd choice)\n* UT Austin (Auto Admit for Liberal Arts but rejected for CS and appeal was rejected. This one hurt the most)\n* Yale\n* Harvard\n* Princeton\n* Stanford\n* UC Berkeley\n* UIUC\n* Duke\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nDuring my junior year, I took 5 AP classes along with band + soccer. I was consistently sleeping for four hours and abused energy drinks. I sacrificed a social life and my mental health in hopes of a better future aka getting into a good college.\n\nMajority of those who saw my results thought that there was a major red flag (negative letter of rec) or poor essays. This can't be the case given my waitlists to top schools like MIT (waitlist rate of 2%). I don't attend a school filled with olympiad winners or isef qualifiers, so acceptances weren't being \"stolen\" by more deserving applicants in my area. I think that my results shed light on the harsh reality of applying CS as an Asian Male, and the randomness of the application process. I know many people with the same demographics who ended off better with objectively worse apps.\n\nI think my shortcomings came down purely to being unlucky, and this arguably makes the results even more painful. Right now, I'm uncertain on where I'll attend or if I'll even be attending college. My advice to any high schooler stressed out about college: spend more time w/ family, friends and enjoy life a little bit more. You can sacrifice a lot and still have nothing to show for your hard work."

I loved my essays so much, I loved writing them and rereading them. Any essay about my major was the theme of zombies and chemistry, which I linked into the real world. I really thought that the ivies would like that.\n\nMy family is proud of me, but I'm sure they were also expecting an ivy. Students from my school were accepted in the past and I had similar profiles to them, so I suppose we hoped too much.\n\nNorthwestern had always been one of my top choices, and I'm very thankful. I honestly think that NU has the perfect balance of work and fun, so I'm looking forward to my time there."

More than trying to find ECs that will look good to the admissions, I was reflecting on what is the common denominator between the different life experiences I had, and what was the ideology behind the big life decisions I made. I developed perseverance and practiced trusting the process.  \n\nMore than anything, I think that I decided to just be who I am, do whatever I wanted in high school, and find the institution that will value that. I intentionally refrained from glorifying any of the schools to avoid fixation, and I am very happy about that. \n\nGood luck to everyone still waiting on final results or applying next year!"

I thought not doing any research or internships/jobs or passion projects would drastically hurt my chances at these top schools, but everything ended up working out in the end. Even if I didn\u2019t get into any of my top schools, I would\u2019ve still been satisfied bc honestly I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve accomplished throughout high school and the impact I\u2019ve made on my community. I think that\u2019s the best outcome you can hope for. So when I opened my first decision of March, Caltech, I was absolutely in shock, then MIT and Rice rolled in too. Lucky to have gotten into my top choices first before getting any rejections.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to have gone so far in my college apps journey, especially given there are so many more qualified applicants."

Loved her so much, she advised me on how I should write my supplemental essays without me asking \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal essay/common app: I loved my personal essay. I talked about what I've learned from my family and how each generation has taught me something. Talked about how we were the first generation to break the cycle of poverty and about my commitment to help break that cycle for others. Showed a lot of character, not so much of a \"sob story\" but a reflection on how I've persevered. When I let others read they cried so I think it was pretty solid. 9.5/10\n\n***Supplementals were a lot of rinse n repeat.***\n\nUGA: Wrote about a book that related to me super well, sci-fi book about a black girl working with technology. I really liked it. 9/10\n\nGT: Most basic/generic supplemental essay. I genuinely could not find something I enjoyed at GT, only applied just to not potentially throw out my chances of getting into a good tech school. Literally could not imagine an enjoyable college experience here. Went from my dream school to not even wanting to apply when senior year came around. Sorry yellow jackets! Accidentally talked about a trip that happened at UGA thinking it was GT\ud83d\udc80 4/10\n\nBU: I really liked this essay. Talked about being an outcast in my community and contributing to closing the digital divide. 10/10\n\nUMich: My favorite essays out of all of them. I still go back to look at them sometimes, felt natural writing these, and AO literally told me how I should write them (not like word for word but gave a lot of advice based on my situation and how I want to go into AI). I think I had a really creative way of answering the community essay and my \"Why Michigan\" essay was so fun to write. 100/10\n\nKSU: First supplemental essays. Super good, talked about AI. Used this essay as a blueprint for some of my later essays. 10/10\n\nNCAT: For the honors application I talked about my chronic disease (the first and only time in all my essays). Reused one of my LIT essays for the prompt since it worked well, but sounded nerdy ngl. Once again tech related and mixed with social justice. 9/10\n\nRPI: Rince and repeat of NCAT and KSU essay. Mostly talked about AI. 8/10, easy because RPI has done a lot with AI.\n\nMercer: They had super fun prompts, especially for the presidential scholarship application. Once again AI and social justice. 10/10\n\n**Acceptances(all accepted for CS):**\n\n`EA: Mercer University (Presidential Scholarship/Full tuition + honors)`\n\n`EA: University of Georgia deferred -> accepted (in-state Hope + Zell covers almost all of tuition)`\n\n`EA: Kennesaw State University (Hope/Zell + honors)`\n\n`EA: North Carolina A&T State University aka NCAT (Honors + finalist for scholarship but I withdrew since I knew I wasn't going to go).`\n\n`EA: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (40k/year in scholarships, Garnet Baltimore and Womens Leadership scholarships, and also gave really good loans)`\n\n`EA: University of Michigan!!

Got in for CS through advanced selection)`\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\nNone\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n`RD: Boston University (gave transfer option)`\n\n`EA: Georgia Tech deferred -> rejected (had the most generic essay and accidentally wrote about something that happened at UGA...)`\n\n`EA: Northeastern deferred -> rejected`\n\n**Direct admissions:**\n\n`Illinois Institute of Technology (17.5k/year)`\n\n`San Francisco Bay University (7.9k/year)`\n\n`University of Tulsa (28k/year)`\n\n`Hartwick College (42k/year)`\n\n`Hope College (19.5k/year)`\n\n`Alma College (31k/year)`\n\n`Merrimack College (27.5k/year)`\n\n`Maine Maritime Academy (7.5k/year)`\n\n`University of Virginia's College at Wise (8kyear)`\n\n`Long Island University (30k/year)`\n\n`Capitol Technology University (11k/year)`\n\n`University of Scranton (27k/year)`\n\n`Missouri University of Science and Technology (13k/year)`\n\n`Roger Williams University (21.5k/year)`\n\n[SHRINE: https://ibb.co/PhJYchB](https://ibb.co/PhJYchB)\n\n***Additional Information:***\n\n\\-Was a scholarship semi-finalist for a program that included BU (my admissions lady even talked to me about it...) Only put this when applying for RD.\n\n\\-Talked about how covid affected me and how my school didn't take the right measures to prevent the spread of covid so I spent the entire year online. ADHD medicine does NOT work well online and libraries were closed so couldn't study outside of home -> lots of distractions. Therapy shut down too, and parents were battling covid for a long time.\n\n\\-Had lots of Cs and Bs freshman year(due to reason above), but showed an upward trend with only A's sophomore to senior year (when I went back in person).\n\n\\-became part of a competitive MIT program AFTER applications, so only mentioned it in my letters of continued interest.\n\n\\-Once again after EA, published in local college newspaper and nominated for a county award.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI was heavily relying on my essays and I'm glad that I was able to enjoy high school without trying to have those \"ivy stats\" and demolishing my entire social life. I have no regrets and I'm glad about how things worked out. However, going through this thread and watching those \"college decision reaction\" videos DEF had me stressed and worried; I won't lie and say this process was easy. Everything works out in the end, and ***GO BLUE!***\n\n**TO ALL THE UNDERCLASSMEN READING THIS, IF THERE IS ONE PIECE OF ADVICE I HAVE IS TO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS EARLY!! SENIORITIS IS VERY REAL AND IT WILL GET YOU.**"

Scholarship to Study-Abroad Program\n2. 2nd Place at State Chemistry Competition\n3. County Essay Contest Semifinalist\n4. AP Scholar with Distinction/National Merit Commended Student\n5. National Honors Society\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n* Computer Science Teacher (7/10): He was the advisor for the CS Club that I started and saw me helping other students when I finished my assignments in class early. We always ate breakfast in class at the same time so we connected over our love of technology and good food! I had him for 2 years and was disappointed I couldn't take more classes with him this year.\n* Spanish Teacher (8/10): I have had 3 classes with her and we have had some great conversations about why learning a second language is so important. She advises the World Culture Club, so I have known her since my freshman year. I have so much energy in her class and am always ready to learn, especially since Spanish is my favorite subject. I will miss her next year!\n* Statistics Teacher (10/10): If you've seen Never Have I Ever, you may recall that Devi wanted a letter of recommendation from an older teacher known for her glowing recommendations. My statistics teacher is known for his strict and old-fashioned approach but I connected with him and he told me what he wrote in the letter. He mentioned how I created a calculator program that related to his lesson plans that he still uses for her class today!\n* School Librarian (9/10): This is probably the adult at my school who knows me best. I talk to her every morning and she has a great sense of my personality. I spend a lot of time in the library and she mentioned a schoolwide app that I created to make it easier for teachers to coordinate events. She was also a former English teacher, so her writing is definitely strong.\n* School Counselor (9/10): Since I attend a public school, most students don't bother getting to know their counselor. However, I had a four-year plan to get into a top school and the first step was making an impression on the administrators in my school. I got to know him pretty well and he likely mentioned my excitement when it came time for course selection because I always came prepared with all of the classes I wanted to take and 3 backups for each!\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* Brandeis (10/10): This was my first interview so I was super nervous, but it went really well! It was with a current student and she thought I would fit into the campus community. It was super easy to talk to her and I connected a lot of my interests to life at Brandeis. I also talked about my visit which made it easier for us to talk about certain aspects of the school\n* Grinnell (8/10): This interview was a little awkward at first but my interviewer and I were both majoring in Spanish and we talked about transitioning to a more rural setting for college and what life in Iowa is like. I learned that double majoring is super common at Grinnell and that was something that appealed to me. Once we got started, the interview went great!\n* Princeton (5/10): This interview was so bad because of issues with scheduling and the interviewer himself. He took 2 weeks to get back to me about a date that worked and he insisted on meeting at 7 AM on a Saturday morning. He only asked me about 5 questions and cut me off after only 15 minutes. I was not left with a favorable impression of the school. He talked for most of the time.\n* Northwestern (6/10): This interview went OK but I was kind of thrown after my Princeton interview and did not do the best job connecting my interests to specific aspects of life at Northwestern. My interviewer was a super interesting guy and he found it fascinating that I wanted to study a language in college. I learned a lot about the school and brought up some interesting questions.\n* Rice (7/10): I found this interview really enjoyable. The guy who interviewed me was successful but not very knowledgeable about Rice. He liked my answers and I came prepared with expert responses about the residential system. He told me his favorite memory of Rice was graduating so I'm not sure what that says about the school... but I enjoyed talking to him.\n* Middlebury (9/10): This interview was amazing! I talked about the Language Houses and my desire to join a tight-knit community with my interviewer. She was a recent alum and reinforced all of the positive things I had heard about Middlebury. The school seemed like a great fit and we had a lot of shared interests that we discussed together. I was left with an overall positive impression.\n* Harvard (7/10): This one was interesting. This was by far my longest interview, which she canceled at the last minute and then rescheduled two times for the same day. Luckily, I never left the place where we were meeting so we still had a great interview. We talked about how so many people put Harvard on a pedestal and discussed language because she majored in the area I was interested in!\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Common App Essay (10/10): I spent a lot of time editing my personal statement and feel it truly encompasses me. I described how my childhood experiences and a study abroad trip to Spain inspired me to found a Spanish Club and bring AP Spanish Literature to my school. I discussed why I started learning Spanish and how I have used it to make an impact on my community.\n* Supplemental Essays (8/10): I discussed how programming languages can be made more inclusive for non-English speakers by examining how language and technology intersect. I suggested a potential solution to make the field of computer science more diverse and break language barriers. I also discussed my religious identity and events I organized at my school, including a Blood Drive.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*SCEA*\n\n* Princeton University - **Rejected**\n\n*EA*\n\n* University of Minnesota - **Accepted** (Honors College) ($84,000 scholarship)\n* University at Albany - **Accepted** (Honors College) ($66,000 scholarship)\n* SUNY New Paltz - **Accepted** ($20,000 scholarship)\n* Binghamton University - **Accepted** (Honors Program) ($54,000 scholarship)\n* Stony Brook University - **Accepted** (Honors College) ($52,000 scholarship)\n* University at Buffalo - **Accepted** (Honors College) ($60,000 scholarship)\n* College of Charleston - **Accepted** (Honors College) ($54,000 scholarship)\n* Rutgers University - **Accepted** (Honors Program)\n* University of Michigan - **Accepted**!!

Allow me to explain how and why I applied to so many schools and what I learned in the process. When I first joined A2C last summer, I was stressed about college and how I would pay for it. Both my parents lost their jobs and I was scared that I would not be able to attend college at all. Applying to college almost became a coping mechanism. Whenever I received an email telling me I could apply in 5 minutes and hear back weeks later, I filled out the form just in case. Soon 1 became 5, and 5 became 10. I had already applied to 15 schools that weren't on my original list of schools by mid-August. With the help of my trusty fee waiver, I applied to all of the competitive schools on my list and added a few extra for good measure.\n\nI had read horror stories of students with 1600 SATs and 4.0 GPAs rejected from every school they applied to, and I wanted to make sure I had plenty of options to choose from. So, not only did I want to get into as many schools as I could, but I wanted to get a full-ride scholarship to take the stress of paying for college off of my parents. However, things changed in December when I found out about a full-ride opportunity through my school. Apparently, the student with the highest test score is eligible for a four-year scholarship that not only covers tuition to any college in the United States but also room and board. I had found the answer to my prayers. I began withdrawing some of the offers that were less affordable and kept 5 of them in case I didn't qualify.\n\nMy school is relatively uncompetitive and I knew I had a shot at getting the scholarship. I felt hopeful that I would be able to go to college and graduate debt-free. This was my way out, and I knew I could get the scholarship if I worked hard enough. I had wanted to apply ED to Cornell, but I was afraid I would not be able to afford it if I got in. Instead, I decided to apply REA to Princeton, even though I knew it was a long shot. My heart shattered when I opened my decision letter on December 15 and saw a big, fat rejection on the screen in front of me. I felt trapped... like I had no shot at getting into competitive schools. *Did I even deserve the acceptances I had already received or were they given to me out of pity*? Luckily, this thought was fleeting. I went back to the drawing board and sent out some extra applications for good measure.\n\nMy mindset changed completely when my EA schools came back. I had so many great options to choose from, and I was able to consider them without worrying about the cost. I was a finalist for the scholarship through my school and I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I had a way out, and there were so many routes that could take me away from the life I knew and bring me to the life I worked for. I felt like all of the sleepless nights and hours dedicated to my schoolwork had finally paid off. I felt confident going into the RD round. *Even if I do not get into any other schools, I have so many great options to choose from*.\n\nNow that the RD bloodbath is finally over, I can finally look back on this whole process with a new perspective. College admissions definitely shaped who I am and I was sure I would be attending UMich or USC until I received the best news I could have imagined. Even though I had ultimately decided against applying ED, Cornell saw something in me that I never could have expected. Not only was I admitted, but I found out today that I am a finalist for the Milstein Program. I am super grateful to have all of these options and I will likely be attending Cornell in the fall if I end up winning the full ride through my school. If not, I should be able to afford Rutgers, and I know I can do great things no matter where I end up. Thank you to everyone who supported me along the way.\n\nNOTE: As I received acceptances, I withdrew applications as I went to make sure I was not taking away space from an applicant who might attend. I only have 10 of these applications still open and will be withdrawing them shortly as I plan to commit to Cornell! GO BIG RED \ud83e\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f!\n\nTLDR; **accepted to University of Florida, University of Southern California, University of Michigan, Colby College, Grinnell College, __CORNELL UNIVERSITY__**\n\nUPDATE: pulled 5 T30s. **Got off the waitlist for Emory and UCLA!**"

This club is where I did most of my competitions and stock analysis publishing work on some well-known websites. \\~$20k profits used to push for student-run investment funds and set up small, internationally reaching stock trading competitions. News coverage by local presses and even the Wall Street Journal (alongside EC #3)\n7. **Piano -** duet@Carnegie Hall + accompanying regional/nat awards. Earlier award and a bit stereotypically \"Asian\", so left as EC and not award. Currently a private coach for kids and I perform at church.\n8. **President of STEM Board-**  Weird thing.

I got some regional awards + some invitational successes, but the bulk of the stuff I did here was teaching olympiad material.\n9. **Chinatown Volunteering Leadership -** handled 5 figure budgets and led student advisory council for large local cultural events and festivals; PVSA 3x Gold + Congressional Award Gold.\n10. **Co-Pres of school Microsoft Excel Club -** unique club in which we helped other clubs handle financial logistics and management.

From submitting essays an hour before they were due, to insane all nighters to juggle everything, I'm shocked yet grateful that things worked out in the end. I'm leaning toward Berkeley and Stanford, but UPenn and Harvard are also close contenders. I'll have to discuss financial aid though but I'll make an edit when I finally commit!\n\nFeel free to find me on the A2C server! I go by Ellie since that\u2019s a variation of my middle name! Don\u2019t be creepy but I\u2019m down to answer questions and whatnot!

        "post": "Hey!\nI am an intl student from India who applied to a bunch of universities in US and UK for mostly business/business economics/finance. I was fortunate to get a lot of offers from some of my top choices:\n\nAccepted:\n1. UCLA (pre business economics; conditional 41+/45)\n2. USC (Marshall business school; spring 2025)\n3. \u2060UT Austin (McCombs business school) \n4. \u2060Emory \n5. \u2060Boston University (Questrom business school)\n6. \u2060UCSD (business economics)\n7. \u2060UIUC (Gies business school) \n8. \u2060St Andrews (financial economics; conditional 38 + 666 in HL)\n9. \u2060Warwick (accounting and finance; conditional 38)\n\nWaitlisted:\n1. UCB (Haas business school) \n2. \u2060CMU (Tepper business school- not sure if I\u2019ll consider over the current choices though if I get in?)\n\nPending:\n1. UCL (statistics, economics and finance)\n\nSo far my personal top choice is UCLA for a pre business economics major, but I\u2019m still really confused since I\u2019ve heard a lot of contrasting opinions on the same since UCLA doesn\u2019t have a business school for undergrad. Currently my top 3 choices are probably UCLA, USC Marshall and UT Austin McCombs- not very sure which one I should choose ultimately. Before the pros and cons just to clarify I come from a business family and although I initially wanted to major in finance (hence mostly applying to business schools), business economics also aligns completely with my interests. Also, I didn\u2019t apply for aid to any of these schools. \n\nThe main pros of UCLA for me are prestige of the uni (qs rank 29, no.1 public; generally much more prestigious universally), location (some family members live in la) and ofcourse lower fees compared to usc. The main disadvantage is not having a business school and possibly the risk of not meeting the conditional (hopefully I\u2019ll fulfil it). \n\nThe main pros of USC are great alumni networks and a prestigious business school (Marshall). Location also (again la). Main disadvantages are that I was admitted to spring 2025 instead of fall 2024, considerably lower ranked compared to ucla and ut (qs rank 116) and more expensive.\n\nFinally the main pros for UT Austin are really good business school (4th best for finance, 5th best for business, 1st in accounting), great chess team (they consistently participate in the pan american games\u2026 sort of a factor for me lol) and cheapest among these 3. Disadvantages are location (austin is a great city but I sorta don\u2019t know anyone there), very less diversity (92% students are from Texas\u2026 only 1.4% intl) and less prestigious and internationally recognised than ucla (qs rank 58; although acceptance rate for mccombs + intl students is much lower overall acceptance rate is abt 30% while ucla and usc are both sub 10%) \n \nSo there are honestly a lot of pros and cons of all these unis but I don\u2019t know which one I should commit to. For the remaining unis I\u2019m just waiting for ucb\u2019s waitlist decisions (incase I get off then it\u2019s def my top choice but that seems very unlikely). Idk if I should consider ucl incase I get an offer!? Sort of made my mind about us now and I\u2019ve no clue when they\u2019ll release offers lmao. I guess the main thing here is idk how important it is if I go to a business school or do a business economics degree\u2026\n\nPlease let me know what you think and incase you are planning to go to any of these schools do pm me (would love to connect :)).\n\nThanks!!"

SHE'S THE SWEETEST PERSON ON EARTH I LOVE HER SO SO MUCH AND WE DID MY BRAG SHEET TOGETHER. She's more of a counselor to me than a biology teacher lol.\n\nMUN Advisor/Eng teacher(10000/10) - He's known me since I was 13 and he used to be a meme among my middle school class. I see him as my second dad and I wish I could share my acceptance w him the moment I got it but he was abroad. He knows almost everything abt me.

I put a lot of effort into them. Except for Columbia where I struggled a lot for some reason. I also kind of half-assed NYU optional and I think it turned out a little cheesy.

These r prob some of the most important parts of my app\n\n  \n1: From Sr Yr STEM teacher. Easily my favorite teacher of all time (and I\u2019ve had many good ones). I talk to her outside of class all the time, and she knows im truly passionate abt physics/STEM. We nerd out over things we see on the internet. Knows me personally super well, and is a rly nice person herself. I did ask her for letter like 2 weeks b4 deadline lol. 11/10 Rec.\n\n2. From Jun. Yr Humanities Teacher. Also another fav teacher. Along w STEM, I have MANY interests in humanities, three main ones being classical literature, philosophy, and rock music. I talked to this teacher abt these 3 interests all the time, and I wrote abt them as passions for many apps. So lots of good overlap prob. Sweetest teacher I ever had. 10/10 rec\n\n3. Regular customer from work. I\u2019ve known him for 15+ yrs, and he\u2019s seen the time + blood, sweat, & tears I\u2019ve had to devote to this obligation. Was able to give valuable insight into who I am outside of the classroom and my competence as a manager. Rly smart + credible person (regional director for corporate chemical giant), and I talk to him regularly abt world affairs + STEM so we have a very strong relationship. 10/10 rec   \nInterviews (Listed In Timeline Order)\n\nPrinceton: Was with a 90 year old man \ud83d\udc80. Honestly a rly good convo that lasted \\~2 hrs, much of which wasn\u2019t even abt the school itself. I could tell he didn\u2019t truly get the nature of college apps nowadays bc he was super impressed by me (even tho my app is not nearly as impressive as many ppl on this sub) and told me he was certain I\u2019d get in (tbf he was ultimately right lmao)\n\nUPenn: Horrible, disaster interview. I saw Penn\u2019s email that these were casual convos and that I didn\u2019t need to prep. Then my interviewer (super awesome girl btw, recent grad) started pulling intense questions out of nowhere, and I gave super shitty responses. Lit a fire in me to prep well for any more upcoming interviews\n\nMIT: 10/10 Got kicked out of Zoom room but we still weren\u2019t done talking lol. My interviewer was a super sweet lady WHO GRADUATED FROM MY LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL \ud83e\udd2f (I got LUCKY in that regard). I came in really well prepped and just nerded out as myself talking abt nerdy crap I loved (physics + MIT go well together surprise surprise). She made sure to lmk that this was just a casual convo from the get go, so I was rly comfortable going in. Also asked rly good questions that I enjoyed answering\n\nYale: 10/10 Was w a current senior there (since no alums in my area). Yale interviews MATTER so pressure was on, but I cooked \ud83d\ude0e. Interviewee was super nice, and I was again well prepped and naturally rambled abt stuff I was passionate abt. He made note to tell me whenever he found my responses to be rly good, which was a gr8 confidence booster thruout. Gr8 questions they ask u too\n\nHarvard: 7/10. Local alum, also a rly nice guy. We laughed together a lot, and talked abt random crap regarding the world and my upbringing. Only reason y 7/10 is bc he was a lawyer and I shitted on \u201cpipeline\u201d careers \ud83d\udc80 I don\u2019t think he enjoyed my response to \u201cwhy Harvard\u201d as, \u201cBc they will support me for whatever iconoclastic field I want rather than just becoming a lawyer or doctor\u201d And I also pronounced a professor\u2019s name wrong, which he made note of \ud83d\udc80  \nEssays  \n\n\n\\*Wrote everything by myself w no outside service help. Had my older best friend as my proof reader, and sometimes English teacher or counselor to read\n\nPersonal statement was abt my 7th grade frog dissection experience LMFAO. For reference, frogs are my worst fear. Made an anagram, and incorporated my love for philosophy a bit. This essay was uber creative (literally the idea came to me while listening to a song) and was completely centered around  \u201cshow-don\u2019t tell\u201d My essay readers all laughed when they read it, and told me it revealed a lot abt my personality. Only problem was that the flow hitched here and there. 9.5/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupplementals I was rly proud of, and I honestly enjoyed writing a majority of them. Talked a lot about my community and extensive work experience. Lots of overlap btw STEM and humanities in these. Many I used extensive humor and personal anecdotes to drive home a message abt myself. Ranged from 8/10-11/10\n\n  \nDecisions   \n**Acceptances**:\n\nMIT (RD)\n\nPrinceton (Deferred REA, yea IKR a damn miracle)\n\nYale (RD)\n\nBrown (RD)\n\nColumbia (RD) (Named as a distinguished scholar!)\n\nCornell (RD)\n\nCarnegie Mellon (RD)\n\nVanderbilt (RD)\n\nAmherst College (RD)\n\nNYU (RD)\n\nOhio State (RD)\n\nState Safety (Rolling)  \n**Waitlists**:  \n\n\nHarvard (RD)\n\nVirginia Tech (RD)  \n**Rejections**:  \n\n\nOhio State Honors \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nOhio State Morrils Scholars Program \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\n  \n\n\nAdditional Information:  \n\n\nGoing into this app cycle, I didn\u2019t expect to get into any reaches (fair given I was first gen). I never used Reddit until like last July to scroll thru A2C for resources and landed upon a cesspool of imposter syndrome. Do not trust everything you see on the Internet, and do not compare yourself to strangers you know nothing about.\n\n Give absolutely everything 100%, even if a school or the internet says an interview \u201cdoesn\u2019t really matter\u201d. Anything could matter at a point where the AO have to make an ultimatum. \n\nDon\u2019t read too into things. For example, I checked my MIT portal like 4 days before decisions rolled out and saw that my fin aide app was missing a doc, but I never got a notif. Thought I was done for. I also got ZERO likely letters. Don\u2019t read into those either (barely anybody gets them besides athletes).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck class of 2025! PM me if anybody has a question\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"

My advice for future college applicants is to try and just enjoy high school as much as you can - for sure keep college in mind, but please don't make it your whole purpose in life or else you'll hate yourself. besides, admissions is really random and you can't control everything, so don't bother trying to. in jean-luc picard's words, \"it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. that's not weakness. that's life.\" So yeah, don't sweat it, just do what you enjoy and you'll end up fine.

These are the ones I am considering in order from most expensive to least.\n\n- NYU\n- University of Chicago (if released from waitlist)\n- Notre Dame\n- Rice\n- UC San Diego\n- OU (outside family has attended and may be able to help cover a portion but highly unlikely)\n- UT Austin (CAP)\n- Texas A&M (guaranteed transfer)\n- University of North Texas \n\n\nI know I am considering a lot of schools (more than some may have the privilege of) and am honestly extremely grateful that I was able to be accepted to several excellent schools even after being rejected from my dream school.\n\nI would love a traditional campus setting that is very pleasing to the eye, but can def settle for any type of campus like one I have to commute to. I aim to study abroad later in undergrad and would like a good school with a good study abroad program. Location: a place where the seasons change and the colors of the leaves change, preferably with mild winters (but atp just changes in season is okay bc I think I\u2019m asking for too much which was why nc stood out sm \ud83d\ude2d). I am also interested in a school with a good sporting culture where I can have fun and enjoy my time there. I may audition for dance teams but if not then I would love to enjoy football and basketball games in the stands.  \n\nAnyways I'm extremely thankful I received these decisions. Please help me choose and comment if you want me to share more info! And if you could, pls provide a realistically affordable option and a top option with no money concerns bc I seriously don\u2019t know what to do"

I wrote about how when I was in middle school I wanted to take my principal's job because he wasn't doing a good job handling homophobia at school, then connected it to a broader theme of believing that if something can be better, it should be (and including anecdotes from my summer job and nonprofit fellowship). My English teacher read it over and said she really liked it/my voice was very strong in it so take that as you will.\n* Interviews - I interviewed at Clark (student), URochester (student), Wheaton (AO), Haverford (alum), Smith (alum), Mount Holyoke (student), Vassar (alum), Yale (alum), Princeton (alum), Harvard (alum), Cambridge (current professors), and WashU for Ervin but not for the general school."

(45 min)\n* Princeton (9/10) - was a bit late to the virtual interview but we had a really good conversation about music and medicine (35 min)\n* Duke (9/10) - Was impressed by me as a highschooler and he was a doctor so he gave me really good advice about the pre med tracjUPenn (10/10) - we also had similar experiences growing up and we were able to bond over shared hardships as well.\n* Yale (10/10): my interviewer was actually so chill and we had a really good discussion about the importance of having things and ideas to stand by and anchor us.\n* Cornell (8/10) - although not an actual interview this was a pretty informative session\n* Dartmouth (8/10) - i again really liked this interview and my interviewer was also a doctor so we linked up on the shared field of interest.\n* Vassar (9/10) - just a really solid interview.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement (7.5/10) - Wrote about baking bread with my special needs brother and how it taught me to appreciate the fact that people we may see as helpless are often skilled in other facets.\n\nI had like 2 rounds of essay writing, QB & BS/MD and Ivy leagues. Most of my BSMD essays were mediocre except for the ones that had that personal aspect in their prompts. My questbridge essays were actually the worst bc they were the first essays I wrote. I ended up not being a finalist so i did QB RD.\n\nI think my top college essays were a lot better bc i had more experience although i actually wrote the majority of these essays in the 3 days before each deadline. Although irresponsible i think i was able to convey my humanity because i was on a time crunch and didnt have time to be so thoughtful and stress over my words. Idk tho.\n\n**College list:**\n\n**BS/MD Schools**:\n\nSeton hall, Penn state, UMKC,Pitt, TCNJ, VCU, University of Rochester, GW, RPI, Case western, Uconn, hofstra, baylor, njit, temple, drexel, brown, rutgers\n\n**QB RD**: denison, colby college, emory, boston university, grinell, amherst\n\n**Others**: Bama, W&J college, MIT, CMU, Stanford, UW, dartmouth, cornell, amherst, vassar, swarthmore, northeastern, washu, penn, vanderbilt, duke, columbia, princeton, northwestern, yale, harvard, johns hopkins, Udel,\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n***Acceptances***:\n\nSeton hall Joint/MD\n\nUMKC (undergrad)\n\nBama\n\nW&J\n\nRutgers (undergrad)\n\nPenn state (undergrad)\n\nPitt (undergrad)\n\nDrexel (undergrad)\n\nTCNJ (undergrad)\n\nVCU (undergrad)\n\nUrochester (REMS BSMD)\n\nUW\n\nRPI (undergrad)\n\nCase western (undergrad)\n\nUconn (undergrad)\n\nHofstra (undergrad)\n\nBaylor (undergrad)\n\nNJIT (undergrad)\n\nTemple (undergrad)\n\n>!Cornell !<\n\n>!Emory!<\n\n>!

I have such immense gratitude for my friends and family that helped me on this journey. I'm not sure how this happened given my overall application quality but i think my essays were extremely genuine (mainly desperation at finishing 46 apps before deadline). My interviews were all extremely good and i didnt have any one horrific encounter. I guess BSMDs dont really like me except REMS which is like the best one. Im not sure where im gonna go but as of right now im just thankful for what i have."

Bachelor of Music programs require prescreening material due by December or January, and if invited, mostly live auditions in February.)\n\nAcademics\n- Weighted GPA (9-11): 3.02 - I believe the highest weighted GPA at my school is 4.1 or 4.2\n-  Semester/semester weighted average breakdown (my school adds 10 points to each AP course): 9: 61.5/71.5  /  10: 95.7/91.8  /  11: 85.5/89.1) \n- Class rank: 196/482\n- Number of APs: 7 in grades 9-11, 4 for senior year \n\nTest Scores \n- SAT: 1270 (690 R+W, 580 Math).

Honestly not sure whether or not they wrote something bad or good about me (however had to submit such letters for said T20 so I guess they were good letters!). I had great sophomore teacher / elective class teacher recommendations.\n\nEssays:\nMy PS was well-written but not very special, so maybe 7/10. I wrote about my journey as a musician. My supplementals were better though, maybe 8/10.\n\nDecisions: \n\nAcceptances:\n- Oberlin Conservatory \n- Vanderbilt University & Blair School of Music\n\n\nRejections:\n- In-state public. Its music school acceptance is contingent upon university acceptance. I was told that despite my sufficient audition, since I was rejected from the university, I was ultimately not admitted.\n- Bard College and Conservatory (double degree program required for all students)\n- Carnegie Mellon Unversity (music performance BFA)\n- Michigan SMTD & LSA (was basically told I would have been accepted if not for my grades)\n- Oberlin College \n- Emory University (does not have a music school, auditioned for scholarship)\n- Northwestern Weinberg\n\n\nDid not pass prescreening:\n- Cleveland Institute of Music\n- Northwestern Universiry Bienen School of Music\n\nWaiting on:\n- Indiana University + Jacobs School of Music. \n\nReflections:\nYes, this was my entire college list. I did not apply to a single safety, despite having been extremely familiar with the college admissions process since freshman year (thus knowing that my chances at getting into lots of these schools were near-impossible). I still held out hope as I was auditioning for these schools & in contact with faculty for my instrument for most of these schools as well. I think my situation is very unique as most musicians at my level usually have excellent academic stats. I don't personally know any competitive candiate for these top music schools with grades as low as mine. I got very lucky, I could have very well been rejected from every school (I would have just applied to and attended one of my local state schools as they take applications through March). Oberlin and Vanderbilt happened to be my top choices as well. I definitely should have applied to more music schools where acceptance is not contingent upon university acceptance (such as Peabody/JHU and Eastman/URoch), but I guess it worked out well in the end. I also should have not fucked around so much in freshman year. Onto the next four though! I will probably be attending Oberlin.\n\n\n\n"

She is known in our school to write amazing letters of recommendations.\r  \n\r\r\n\n**AP English Language and Composition Teacher/Student Congress Advisor**: **7/10**. She has a great way with words in her past letters of recommendations. Also, I got to know her more through me being class president for the past four years. \r  \n\r\r\n\n**AP Calculus AB/BC Teacher**: **7/10**.

He is also very good with letters of recommendations.\n\n\r  \n\r\r\n\n**Interviews**\r  \n\r\n\nI was asked to be interviewed by MIT, Princeton, and Harvard. Yale and Stanford didn\u2019t even reach out. \r  \n\r  \n\rMIT: 5/10. We didn\u2019t really hit it off. In all honesty, I only applied here because my mom wanted me to. I knew I didn\u2019t have a chance because of my SAT score, but I already had the essays written from passed prompts so whatever. Also, I quickly lost interest in MIT after submitting my application.\r  \n\r\r  \nPrinceton: 7/10. We talked all about research. It was great. \r  \n\r\r  \nHarvard: 10/10. He was so chill. We bonded over research, and talked a lot about the Harvard Housing System.\r  \n\r  \n\rEssays\r  \n\r\r  \nI really can\u2019t comment on my essays. But, after giving them to individuals who have been accepted to higher education institutions, they all really liked my essays. Specifically, my common app essay. I talked about my hobby of memorizing patterns on flags, and what is really on my flag. This really let me speak about my unique qualities \u2013 especially because affirmative action was not present in this cycle.\r  \n\r  \n\rDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\r  \n\r\r  \nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech) REA: >!Deferred \u2192 Accepted!!!!!!!!

I am currently choosing between Harvard or Caltech. Two completely different universities dynamically, whether I want a heavy curriculum focus college experience or not. I will definitely take all of April to decide.\n\nI almost didn't even apply as CS. I was going to apply as environmental science because of my research experience, which thankfully I did not. For those worrisome about applying as a CS major, give yourself confidence. That's what I truly needed at the time of applying.\r  \n\r  \nI would also like to thank the A2C and related subreddit communities. Yes, sometimes the communities are very cringe and goofy, but at its core, they have been my best place to find advice. \r  \n\r  \nFor juniors or underclassmen reading Chance Mes and College Results posts, just like how I was these past 3 years, I have some advice. Please, please, please, shoot your shot. I was not going to apply to the Coca-Cola Scholarship because I thought it was not attainable, but I submitted the application 10 minutes before the deadline. Now I don\u2019t live a life of regret. \r  \n\r  \nAlso, it would be ignorant for me to not mention this but, I got REALLY REALLY lucky. I am truly blessed. As colleges are going back to test-required admissions, like Brown (a university I got in without one), the SAT/ACT will differentiate yourself with the applicant pool. Please take BOTH the SAT and ACT. I am a true believer of the practice of taking one test over the other strictly because of fit.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, I know applying to college is hard. SO START EARLY! I finished my common app essay in July before senior year and finished all of my supplemental essays for my early applications at the end of September. However, I didn\u2019t take my own advice and finished all of my regular decision applications moments before the deadline. But, thankfully it played out well for me.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, APPLY TO EVERY SINGLE SCHOLARSHIP! I know it\u2019ll just be more applications but trust me just do it. I applied to scholarships I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d win, outside of Coca-Cola, and thankfully everything played out. \r  \n\r  \nAlso, APPLY TO FLY-IN PROGRAMS! I got into Caltech Up Close - a fly-in program with Caltech. And I am 100% sure that this was the reason why I was not rejected early and soon accepted. 25% of the people who got into Caltech Up Close GOT INTO CALTECH! So please, apply everywhere. I know Caltech, MIT, Columbia, Michigan Ross, Dartmouth, Williams, and so many more universities have fly-in programs. I believe there is a CollegeVine post with all of them listed.\r  \n\r  \nSo yea, thank you for reading this very long post which I have waited 4 years to create. If you have any questions, my Reddit DMs are open. Have a great day!\r  \n"

Very personal and specific. Connected my interests together into a story. Essays were professionally reviewed, and I also asked a lot of people I knew to review them. Never really felt the stress of deadlines. \n\n# Decisions\n\nIn-State unis \u2014 >!accepted!<\n\nNorthwestern (ED) \u2014 >!accepted + committed!!!!<\n\n>!LETS GOOO WILDCATS RAHHHHH!!!!<\n\n# Final Takeaways/Tips: \n\nDO NOT procrastinate on college apps. Start during the summer to give yourself a big advantage. Finish college list research in junior year so you don't have to worry about that later. If you can afford it, get professional help on your essays. If you can't get as many people as you can to look at your essays. \n\nRead college essays that were successful and use them as benchmarks to compare your essays. This was my #1 resource while writing college essays. Don't assume that because you are good at writing, your essays will be effective. College essays are a completely different style of writing than let's say, creative or informative writing. \n\nAlso, make sure your essays answer the prompt. This sounds obvious, but it's easy to drift away and start talking about something completely irrelevant. \n\nAbuse your connections. Ask your parents, friends, and teachers about people they can connect you with. Use nepotism to find college app activities like research internships and volunteer opportunities. This is more normal than it seems, especially when finding jobs and internships.\n\nDO NOT take 18 AP courses. 5-10 is the sweet spot. I thought maxing out my coursework would be a great look for colleges, but it defo took away a ton of time that I could have spent on ECs instead. Also, try to take APs related to your major. \n\nEarly Decision doesn't necessarily mean that you have a higher chance. ED/REA applicant pool actually tends to be stronger, because people are more committed and spend more time on essays. Spend as much time and effort as you can on your ED/REA application. After all, it should be your top choice. \n\nDo ECs that you enjoy. Don't join a club just because it will look good on your app. Also look for niche competitions that relate to the things that you do. For me, I never felt like I was stat padding because all my ECs related to passions. \n\nIf you do research, make sure it has an impact (publication, science fair, presenting to officials/at conferences). That makes it 10x more effective on your application. \n\nCollege applications are not a competition! Colleges really don't have quotas. One person getting in does not mean another will get rejected in the same school. Make sure to help your friends who are struggling with their essays, especially if you were accepted ED. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to reach out to me with any questions! Also please don't doxx me :)"

Or Game Design for the schools that offered it\n\nGPA: 3.87\n\nSAT: 1350(not reported on most applications)\n\nPretty much all my classes were IB, I took 3 HLs(Literature, Psych and Spanish)\n8 \n\nExtracurricular: 2 were coding related(I took online classes and practiced over summers), 2 were mentorship positions(1 paid, the other was volunteering), 1 club leadership postion - Vice President of a Debate Club, 1 religious volunteering position, and the rest were school club-related\n\nCommon app Essay: I wrote about experiencing social growth after having major setbacks from the pandemic that lingered well after 2020. I feel like it was a pretty good essay. Now, as for supplemental essays... well as we can see from the decisions, they maybe weren't as good as I thought. And ALL the schools that rejected/waitlisted me had supplemental essays.\n\nExtras? I am black, female, Nigerian and that's pretty much it.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nAccepted - University of Michigan(Ann Arbor - i don't know if i was accepted into their CS program just yet bc of advance selection), Michigan State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology\n\nWaitlisted - University of Wisconsin Madison and Carnegie Mellon University(my personal fav \ud83d\udc94)\n\nRejected - University of Maryland College Park, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Cornell University\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, I will probably end up in a state school. My older sister got accepted into Umich, and while I personally don't want to continue the whole \"following my sister's footsteps\" thingy, my parents are very dead-set on thinking that Umich is the best school in the world and that I should go... so yay me"

Huge local impact. I elaborated on this EC in my additional info section.\n\n2 President of my student media team at school (also a graded class): Doubled numbers post-COVID and started back up the school website, newspaper, and slideshow. Note: If you're going to list a class-related activity, please make every effort to emphasize the work you did outside of class.\n\n3 Cared for my grandma with dementia, including watching her when she'd otherwise be home alone, calming her down when she gets frantic, driving her places, etc. Huge time commitment and very impactful for me\n\n4 President of chamber singers (by audition) at school; PMEA choir festivals\n\n5 Cross country (JV/V 10th grade, varsity 11th and 12th)\n\n6 Managing my grandparents' online presence for their catering business, as well as working as a caterer.

She talked about how I stuck with student media even though I couldn't be graded member of the class and transformed the media team, as well as a lot of amazing stuff about my personality. Love her <3\n\nCivics/AP Euro Teacher - 6/10: This wasn't up to par because I thought she would give me a great letter of rec but I later found out a lot of it was just copy and paste. She did, however, add in a paragraph about how I wasn't afraid to be wrong and was very open-minded. It wasn't a bad letter by any means! just not at the level the others were at.\n\nChoir teacher/my literal second mom - 9.5/10: She's taken me across the state of PA to choir festivals, she's given me courage to be who I am, and... the letter is just so amazing. She talked about how she entrusts me with her children (I babysit for her) and it was just so great.\n\nPeer rec - 8.5/10: My vice president of student media. Her writing style is very unique. Her final sentence was \"Your campus deserves an \\[NAME\\] so someone can get through their college experience, just like how he helped me get through my high school one.\" We're so close and I'm so grateful she agreed to write one for me. **NOTE: I sent this peer rec not only to Dartmouth (which wanted one) but also Harvard, Stanford, and Northwestern. Some people may have seen this as unprofessional. I really had hope it would help me. All I can say is look at the results below and do with them what you will.**\n\nInterviews\n\nBowdoin College (4/10): This interview was my first and it was super shaky with online connection. I talked a little too quickly and accidentally made my words come across as if I got burnt out easily. Overall it went well, but we didn't connect much and the interview was fairly short.\n\nStanford University (8/10): I felt super confident after this one. I made sure my Bowdoin interview mistakes weren't a problem here, and I really connected with my interviewer! He said he would \"only put good things in for my admission file.\"\n\nBrown University Video Response (#/10): I really can\u2019t rate this. It could have been 5/10, it could\u2019ve been 10/10; I\u2019m too biased to give a good rating. I recorded it on my phone (in one take) in the cemetery I did my Eagle Project, showed two examples of my work, and then launched into a conversation about how the church the cemetery is connected to believes \u201call homosexuals will go to hell\u201d yet I decided to serve the church and complete my project there because I knew it would benefit the community more than the church itself. Closed it all out by saying I learned how accessible making an impact is from it all. A lot of my friends said it was a little scatter-brained. I was colddddd though, I had been in a freezing cemetery for an hour lol\n\nEssays\n\nPersonal Essay (9.5/10): It was about how I dealt with myself and the people around me discovering I had perfect pitch when I was 16. I delved a lot into my childhood synesthesia and how it translated into my interests today. I talked about dealing with other people's opinions and deciding to prioritize myself while responding to people how I wanted to respond.\n\nAs for my other essays, I'd like to think they were pretty good. I talked a lot about growing up queer in a rural, non-accepting area, caring for my grandparents, gardening with emphasis on local impact, and discovering something life-changing in a book I read. Of course, I forced myself not to go back and look at them because that just leads to terrible looping thought patterns lol. I spent so much time writing them, but I notably didn't go back and rewrite as much as I probably should have. I'd give them, overall, an 8.5/10.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\nSeveral local schools, including one full ride\n\nArizona State University (Rolling) (21K a year scholarship)\n\nIthaca College (EA) (30K a year scholarship)\n\nUniversity of South Carolina and their Honors College (EA) (Tuition reduced to in-state and 2K extra off)\n\nPenn State and their Honors College (EA) (Still haven't gotten any financial info :/ love PA in-state options)\n\nSyracuse University (RD) (30K a year scholarship + Honors College Invite)\n\nColorado College (EA)\n\nBrown University (RD)!!!

I am STILL IN SHOCK.\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\nNorthwestern University (RD)\n\nDartmouth College (RD)\n\nTufts University (RD)\n\nNortheastern (EA) (Deferred --> Waitlisted | haha yay corrupted admissions processes)\n\n**Rejections:**\n\nAmherst College (RD)\n\nBowdoin College (RD)\n\nHarvard University (RD)\n\nStanford University (RD)\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nTo all the rural applicants reading: There IS so much hope for you guys. Colleges are great at looking at everything in context and measuring relative achievement. I also think my class rank should prove to prospective applicants that T20s will not throw away applications just because their class rank is not up to par, even without context."

Didn\u2019t really had much outside of class experiences with her but we were great in class. Counselor said the rec was glowing, one of the best she\u2019d seen in years.\n\nGender Studies teacher (8-9/10): was very active in her class. We talked a lot about creative writing, neurodiversity, and gender studies. I wrote my gender research with her help, wrote the disability studies course with her, and did a school-wide queer- neurodiversity awareness campaign as a class project. So we were great both in and out of class.\n\nNeurodiversity club advisor (8/10): she\u2019s not a teacher but we were very close, since I spent a lot of time on neurodiversity awareness and stuff. So she can really comment on my passion for advocacy.\n\n\n**Interviews**  \nMIT - It was okay. Wasn\u2019t the best but it wasn\u2019t terrible.\n\nPenn - above average good. Talked a lot about writing, neurodiversity, and social justice.\n\nMiddlebury -  probably the chillest one, mainly talked about writing.\n\n\n**Essays**  \nI grinded them so hard. For my main essay I talked about finding anchors of identities through writing and advocating for minority rights. In my supplementals, I connected my interest in literature and music and my passion for spotlighting diverse voices with the community programs each school offers. I also talked about how I hope to use language as a tool to make changes. All in all I was trying to say that I\u2019m passionate about deconstructing what is discriminatory and not inclusive, and reinventing social constructs.\n\n**Decisions**  \nAcceptances:  \n\nUMich (EA, Creative Writing)\n\nUSC (EA, Creative Writing)\n\nWellesley College (RD, English, likely attending!!!)\n\nUCD (RD, Sociology)\n\nUCI (RD, Gender Studies)\n\nUCSD (RD, Literature: Writing)\n\nUCSB (RD, Feminist Studies)\n\nUW Seattle (RD, Disability Studies)\n\n\n\nWaitlists/Deferrals:  \n\nPenn CAS (Deferred then rejected)\n\nColumbia (Waitlisted)\n\nUCLA (Waitlisted)\n\nUCB (Waitlisted)\n\nVassar College (Waitlisted)\n\nWesleyan University (Waitlisted)\n\nAmherst College (Waitlisted)\n\nRejections:  \nHarvard, MIT, Yale, Northwestern, Duke, Cornell, Middlebury, Williams\n\n\n**Final thoughts**:\nThis was such a great journey. Sure, I was a bit disappointed when ivy day turned out to be a rejection party, and for a second doubted whether I should\u2019ve written and done so much about autism, queerness, and my passion for social deconstructions, and whether being autistic made me less \u201cdesirable\u201d as an applicant, but I\u2019m all happy now. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I don\u2019t regret a single thing I\u2019ve written or done, nor do I regret being myself. If I\u2019m rejected for showing my true self, then so be it. I should be going to a school that understands, appreciates and celebrates every part of me, including my identities, my passions, and my shortcomings. And for that, nowhere else is more perfect than Wellesley to me.\n\nNow, I\u2019m really glad that going through this process made me more sure of who I am. And congrats to everyone, no matter where you\u2019re going, you\u2019re going to crush it and have the best 4 years of your life."

While most other ones seem over exaggerated, I genuinely had a good connection and she talked about me a lot with other teachers and even in the class (she said I was better than all the seniors in the class as when I took AP Physics as an underclassman lol)  \nAPUSH Teacher (8/10) - I was very attentive and the teacher really liked me. I sat in the front and everybody knew he liked me. I also asked him for help a lot and eventually became his TA.\n\n**Interviews**  \nMIT - I thought it went great. He said I was a good interviewee.  \nPrinceton - It was a good interview. Not much else lol.\n\nStanford - I really liked this one. I thought I hit it off with my interviewer and I also got some good laughs with him. We talked about a variety of subjects but mostly about exploration.\n\nHarvard - My interviewer was from my high school, so we talked a lot about that, my instrument, and the sport scene (including math team and science oly).\n\n**Essays**  \nI spent so many hours on the essays. All my supplementals were curated and had good writing, and my main essay was the cherry on top. I wrote about some artifacts we keep in our house for my main essay. My supplementals were strong and detailed my major and had lots of connections to other topics I was interested in.\n\n**Decisions**  \nAcceptances:  \nState Uni where I did research (EA)  \nUW-Madison (for AMEP Program) (EA)  \nU Maryland - College Park (Aerospace Engineering) (EA)  \nPurdue University (Aerospace Engineering) (EA)  \nUIUC (got into second choice which was Engineering Mechanics. My first-choice was CS+Physics) (EA)  \nU Mich (Engineering Physics) (EA)  \nGeorgia Tech (Physics, but would do EE as well) (EA)                                                                                                                 UW-Seattle (RD)  \nHarvey Mudd College (RD, likely attending!)\n\n  \nWaitlists/Deferrals:  \nCaltech (REA - Deferred -> Rejected)  \nUC Berkeley (Waitlisted, pulled off)  \nCornell (Waitlisted)  \nCMU (Priority Waitlist)\n\nRejections:  \nHarvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Yale, Caltech, UCLA, Northwestern\n\n**Additional Merit Awards:**\n\nU-Mich Engineering Scholarship of Honor (25k/yr), GaTech Stamps Semifinalist (175 kids selected from 32k EA2 applicants), Harvey S. Mudd Merit Award (10k/yr), University of Maryland Presidential Scholar (8k/yr), UW-Seattle Purple and Gold Scholarship (6k/yr)\n\n**Final thoughts**:\n\nI thought this process was quite fun honestly. Yes, I did not get into a lot of colleges, but I'm still happy for my results. After seeing and looking at all my colleges, I noticed that HMC would be the one college where I fit in almost perfectly, not to mention that I would succeed there socially and academically (and have a strong starting salary!). I don't feel bad that I didn't get in, nor that others did, because top colleges pick a class based on how students are and how they fit into making the college fulfill its goals. Being the top student in the admitted pool in one place does not mean you'd even get in for another (take myself as an example), but it still shows that one can succeed no matter what. I'm excited to continue my life in California and I'm ready for what comes next!"

It was about a small business I run and how I use all proceeds to support middle and high school education for underrepresented minorities within my community.\n\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n(12/10) apush teacher - I have been very involved with this teacher since my sophomore year of high school. They speak very highly of me, always saying that I am the \u201cfaculty\u2019s right hand\u201d and while I did not read their LOR, I am sure they didn\u2019t miss a beat.\n\n(9/10) ap world teacher - having seen my work ethic throughout high school in addition to my commitment to service and higher education, I know that they were able to incorporate my past and present extracurriculars and dedications in their LOR. I had read their LOR the previous year for a program I applied to and they spoke very highly of me \n\n(7/10) counselor - while they did not know many specifics about me, I would typically be the first person they would ask to manage school events if they ever needed help. I think they spoke highly of my undying dedication to service and always helping teachers and faculty on campus. I am not sure how effective their LOR was as they transferred schools halfway through the year\n\n\nInterviews\n\n(8.5/10) duke: super enjoyable. We bonded over Duke\u2019s dance team (she was on the team and I stated my deep interest in auditioning). I asked several questions and wished her luck with grad school at the end of the interview. I followed up with her after as well. This was honestly the best interview I had.\n\n(8/10) rice: super engaging. She was from my city and I got to learn several things abt rice that I didn\u2019t get to learn on the tour I went on the year prior.\n\n(9/10) Georgetown: I truly loved this interviewer. She was super cool, I got to learn a lot about campus, showed how interested in Georgetown I was and showed the love I have for my school and family. I mentioned something my dad taught me and she loved that \u201ctip\u201d he gave me that I shared with her!\n\n(8/10) Princeton: she is from my hometown. Asked plenty about her experiences at Princeton and why she chose to attend. Nothing bad to say abt this interview at all.\n\n(7.5/10) Dartmouth: I think I sort of butchered this interview by myself. My responses to the interviewers questions were very bland and I felt like I didn\u2019t do my best. I was also very ill the week of my interview and wasn\u2019t feeling the best either\n\n(6/10): UPenn: my interviewer appeared to be uninterested the entire time. I asked several questions hoping to brighten up the mood which they would only answer blandly. I was really excited abt this interview and came out of it disappointed \n\n(?/?): Stanford: I didn\u2019t receive an invitation for an interview even though other students at my school received one.\n\n\nEssays\n\n(7/10) personal statement: it was mid. I finished it 1 day before November 1st. It was so stressful. I had teachers on campus and some of my peers review it. They liked it but I know all of theirs were way better. My essay was around 610 words. I wanted to add more but I knew that I would need to reformat my essay and was not up for the task. I feel like the quality was there but I could have made it much much better\n\n(6/10) duke supps: i think my \u201cwhy duke\u201d lacked a lot of character. I had an idea of what I wanted to incorporate but because of the time crunch and my prioritization of my personal statement, I feel like it was worse than anticipated. I incorporated the themes from my personal statement, but I feel as though it was bland since I wasn\u2019t very specific about anything in particular.\n\n\nDecisions\n\nAccepted:\n\n- EA: Pepperdine\n- EA: Pepperdine\n- RD: Baylor \n- RD: DePaul\n- RD: Fordham\n- RD: NYU\n- RD: Rice\n- RD: TCU\n- RD: UC Davis\n- RD: UC San Diego\n- RD: UC Santa Barbara\n- RD: OU\n- RD: Notre Dame\n\nGuaranteed Transfer:\n- Priority: UT Austin\n- RD: TAMU\n\nWaitlisted:\n- RD: UChicago\n- RD: Northeastern\n\nRejected:\n- RD: Cornell\n- RD: Dartmouth\n- RD: Duke :( (Deferred ED)\n- RD: Emory\n- RD: Georgetown\n- RD: Princeton \n- RD: Stanford\n- RD: UC Berkeley \n- RD: UPenn\n- RD: USC (deferred EA)\n- RD: Vanderbilt\n- RD: WashU\n- RD: Yale\n\n\n\nI think two things in particular killed my application. (1) I applied test optional. If I had applied with competitive SAT scores, I truly do believe that it could have helped my application, even if it was ever so slightly. (2) Nothing in my application demonstrated my interest in my chosen major. I had no research or competitions that had to do with my major. I did not write papers or create a significant start-up company that had the ability to make my application stand out. And while none of that is necessary, I think my application made me a \u201ctypical applicant\u201d which resulted in my rejections (especially from my dream school Duke\u2026)\n\nI haven\u2019t decided on a school yet. I will probably be asking for opinions on which school to choose on a later post.\n\nIf you have any questions, definitely feel free to message me!\n \n\n"

I wanted it to end so badly, it was so awkward. but he said he would write a good report about me and that he hoped I got in so that was good I guess.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n* Acceptances:\n   * UC Berkeley (RD) out of state\n   * Claremont McKenna (RD), Wagener global scholar\n   * American University (RD), $15k/yr dean's scholarship\n   * Occidental (RD), $15k/yr honors scholarship\n   * Loyola Marymount - school of film and television (EA), $2k early action award, $14k/yr arrupe scholarship\n   * Santa Clara (EA), $18k/yr dean's scholarship\n   * University of Arizona (rolling admissions), $30k/yr scholarship\n   * University of Pittsburgh (rolling admissions)\n   * my two state schools (rolling admissions), presidential scholarship and honors college to both\n* Waitlists:\n   * Villanova, deferred EA & waitlisted RD\n   * Wesleyan (RD)\n   * UNC Chapel Hill (RD)\n   * Emory (RD)\n* Rejections:\n   * UChicago (ED)\n   * Northeastern, deferred EA & rejected RD\n   * UCLA (RD)\n   * Tufts (RD)\n   * Northwestern (RD)\n   * Georgetown, deferred EA & rejected RD\n   * Yale (RD)\n   * Princeton (RD)\n   * Harvard (RD)\n   * Duke (RD)\n   * Columbia (RD)\n   * Brown (RD)\n   * Stanford (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nWorked 30-35 hours my junior yr to support my family, which affected my grades (wrote about this more in detail on common app additional info section)"

I will say that I asked my junior year math teacher and junior year English teacher for recs.

UCs were okay but were written in 2 weeks. Other RDs were written also in roughly 2 weeks but the UCs and RDs were honestly not going to get much better with more writing/thinking time.\n\nUC PIQs, I chose greatest talent (self-reflection, but everyone has to do this at some point in the college process), significant challenge (lack of patience), academic subject (math and how I find it applicable and defines just about anything), community (talked about motivation to coach stemmed from my own experience being coached when I was younger and also what I did as a coach to relate to swimmers)\n\n\r  \n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\r  \n\r  \nAcceptances:\r  \n\r  \nUCI\n\nUCSD\n\nUCSB\n\nUC Berkeley\r  \n\r  \nWaitlists:\r  \n\r  \nGeorgia Tech (Only EA, deferred -> waitlist)\n\nUCLA\n\nUC Davis\r  \n\r  \nRejections:\r  \n\r  \nCaltech\n\nHarvey Mudd\r  \n\r  \n**My own comments:**\n\nI will likely not answer questions since this is a throwaway account and I want to avoid giving myself away as much as I can. A lot of the things here are definitely not easy for everyone to achieve but certainly not unique (especially among asians, doing a sport, music, and math is quite stereotypical). \n\nI felt compelled to post this because one, I feel like there's a lack of math posts (but that also probably has to do with a lack of math majors in general...). Two, throughout the process and likely for people who scroll through college reddit servers, there's a feeling that you need to hop on that grind and start churning through research, club leadership, code something, competitions, etc. \n\nWhile it may not be applicable to everyone, all I focused on was doing good in math since it was the one subject I felt decently happy doing and was good at and then just did whatever else I consistently enjoyed doing. I looked into a couple clubs but didn't want to spend my lunches grinding out more things, tried an olympiad once but didn't like it very much, and avoided courses that weren't my interest nor were very related to what I was doing (even if it harmed the look of my course rigor, looking at you AP Lit/Bio). In crude words, I stayed in my own bubble. \n\nI know not everyone can do this many college courses at a high level (and especially since a decent amount of them were online/asynchronous so I could save time) nor do I know if my essays did manage to come out as something genuine or unique. And yes, I'm sure I also got lucky and some people don't know what to do or feel that they're not good enough to do something. To that, I understand that feeling because I'm still unsure of what I'm doing and if you dig deep into a person's essays, I'm sure many of them will have shaky motivations. I offer encouragement to still seek out things until you can settle on something you can consistently do that you find minor enjoyment in without pulling your hair out. \n\nBut I hope people can see that you can still be rewarded for doing the typical school things (get good grades, balance your life/health by doing a sport or going outside, having a hobby even if it's playing video games). And even if things don't work out, you'll feel a heck of a lot better knowing that you have good habits."

But to all the juniors applying next year who truly do love CS and want to major in CS, major in CS. It's undeniably a little rough out there, but choose a major you're truly excited about and can actually see yourself pursuing. The data science/EE/CE to CS major pipeline works out sometimes, and sometimes not--it's pretty hard to switch into a CS major especially at public unis where CS is absolutely massive already (think UC's), so if CS is what you absolutely want to do, then choose CS.\n\nThere are honestly so many things I wish I could have done differently with my app, esp when it comes to essays. CS is tough but I did terribly with OOS schools even by CS standards, and although I'll never really know for sure what went wrong, I would say my presentation of my profile was the biggest factor of getting so many denials. I don't have any STEM awards and my EC's are also a little scattered, and I don't think my personal statement was as good as it could've been. For those applying next cycle, start early! Essays take a LOT longer than you think they do, so start brainstorming early, go through a whole bunch of drafts, and get multiple sets of eyes to help you proofread and catch things you miss when you're reading your own writing (more than just spelling/grammar, be careful w sounding arrogant/overconfident, talking too much about what you hope to accomplish in the future rather than what you've already done and how that impacts you and your future plans, etc).\n\nHave a group of supportive friends & trusted adults during the whole application and decision process, too! I cannot even begin to express my gratitude for the two friends of mine who really supported me through \\~15 straight rejections and my parents, recommenders, and counselor for being safe spaces when I was at my absolute lowest, thinking I completely messed up and I might've gotten better results if I'd just applied to a less competitive major. i'm so incredibly grateful and excited to be going to cal in the fall, and thank u A2C for being a community i could turn to during the entire process. good luck to everyone applying next year!! <3"

However, I did act out in her class for physics 1 a lot when I was dealing with a lot at home and mentally and got kicked out of her class one time, but we had conversations where I feel like I have made it up and did a lot of apologizing because I regret what I did a lot.

She also is an avid reader of the paper. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nInterviews\r  \n\r  \nI'm a theater kid so I am very good at BSing and keeping a conversation but I will say my Stanford interviewer did go into politics which I should have avoided bc the interviewer admitted to having conservative views. he did say he would recommend me to the committee, however. I do feel that all the interviews were good:\n\n\r  \nYale, Bowdoin, Middlebury, Denison, Tufts, Stanford, Colby (for scholars program)\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nEssay\r  \n\r\r\n\nI feel like my essay was kind of funny but then it gets serious. It started with an argument my family had over buying guacamole at a restaurant. The argument was symbolic of their different values in life, living in different separate cultures. The main point was also that they also grew up poor yet had different opinions over the guacamole. I then to proceed to talk about my moms family and then my dads family and how both families had horrible situations. Even though my dads family grew up even poorer, they were happier because they focused on the little things in life and used their money to buy stuff that they enjoyed even if it was not beneficial. My mom's family, however, continues to be unhappy to this day despite many making it out of poverty and it helped them to do so by adopting strict money saving habits and often did not go spending their money.\n\nThen I bring it back to myself and how poverty did not end with me. I reflect and say that I was unsure based on my mom's family that I would be happy if my family had more money. I talked about how I have been living similarly to my mom's family by working excessively hard and not enjoying life as much. I end by saying that the little things in life are worth more than all the money I'd make in my lifetime and will adopt the values that my father's family had.\n\nTo quote the very end \"So I've decided... At \\[restaurant\\] I'll buy the large bowl of guacamole, maybe even the queso too,\" bringing it back to where the essay started. \n\n\r  \nDecisions:\r  \n\r  \n**Acceptances:**\r  \n\r  \nPomona, Bowdoin, Colby, College of the Holy Cross, Occidental, Swarthmore, Tufts, Middlebury, CWRU, Vassar, Hamilton, and Boston College\n\n(there's some safeties but it would take a lot to list)\r  \n\r  \nWaitlists:\r  \n\r  \nYale, Penn, Denison, Grinnell, Northwestern, Oberlin, Wesleyan, Bates, Skidmore\r  \n\r  \nRejections:\n\n\r  \n\rWilliams (ED), Amherst, Harvard, Dartmouth, Columbia, Stanford, and Brown.\n\n\r  \nAdditional Information:\r  \n\r  \nI feel like my application showed quirkiness and diverse interests that would excel at an LAC but not a spike per se that the Ivies may want. Additionally, many of my ECs were not long commitments and I had only started theater my junior year, along with vocal groups. Although they could have seriously not liked me, I feel like I might have been rejected simply due to fit and not qualifications. I love the LACs a lot and even though it did hurt not getting into a single ivy, I tbh did not really want to go to one and thought I would thrive more at a LAC. Additionally, I want to go to grad school, so I was really interested in the LACs. It made it easier writing their supplementals. I also saved the Ivies for last when I was LOCKED IN writing all the supplemental during winter break, which could have backfired because by then I was burnt out writing their supplementals.\n\n\r  \nEither way, I am happy with my results, and I'll take it as a sign from the Gods that I am meant to go to a LAC and I will be enjoy the sunny California weather because I think I will commit to Pomona!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\r"

        "post": "Hey guys! I posted here when things were not going well after the early round, but it seems like things have turned out fine in the end! It feels insane that this is all over now. Feel free to ask me any questions, and I would love some suggestions on what you guys would pick. Overall, I'm satisfied with my results. I'm facing a really tough choice of program right now, and I don't think I'd necessarily feel any happier if I was choosing between any school that I wanted, so that's an amazing place to be! I wanted to write this post so I can look back at it in a long time and see everything that went into this whole process.\n\nI also wanted to give a more in-depth perspective about all the different things that go into the process (e.g, decision rounds, informal recs, unusual coursework, interviews) because I think there's a big assumption that you sort of put your \"worth\" into the process and get rewarded with a certain tier of school that you \"deserve\" to attend, but nobody really ever tells you about the random minutiae that go into the process that can influence decisions (not to mention institutional priorities totally outside your control).\n\nWith that being said, here's who I was between December and January, as far as it's relevant to my application!\n\n**DEMOGRAPHICS**:\n\nWhite, male, semi-competitive top-heavy public school in northeast.\n\nNot seeking need-based financial aid.\n\n**Hooks**: 5x legacy at Harvard. Soft support for a niche sport at Harvard.\n\nIntended major: Economics, unless otherwise specified in the results section.\n\nGPA: 3.96 weighted, 4.83 weighted (Class rank \\~25/700). 5.0 GPA first semester senior year. One B in calc 3 as a junior and a few non-honors classes because I was homeschooled until 8th grade, which pulled this down a lot.\n\n**Test scores:**\n\n- 1600 SAT, ACT not submitted.\n\n- 13 APs taken, taking 7 more senior year. Submitted 5's on Physics C Mechanics, Physics C E&M, BC Calculus, AB Calculus, Psychology, Comparative Gov, US Gov, Macroecon, Microecon, APUSH, Compsci Principles + pending scores in English Lit, Spanish Lang, Euro, Envsci (Self-study).\n\n**Course rigor:**  \n  \nTop10 within my school. Took the most APs of anyone in my class. Took calc 3 and physics c as a junior, taught myself Spanish and skipped 4yrs of Spanish after my sophomore year (hadn't studied before due to homeschooling), self-studied differential equations and linear algebra.  \n  \n**EXTRACURRICULARS**:\n\n1. Founded international recruitment agency based in small African country alongside local partner. Found full time remote-work employment for 15+ locals. Earned $100k+ in revenue (this has taken up 20hrs/week+ since my sophomore year and was a major focus of my essays since my main career goal right now is to grow this while in college).\n2. Largest fundraiser for largest pro-democracy organization with 200k+ members in aforementioned African country, raising $10k+. Helped to develop election and campaign strategy resulting in 5 members of parliament being elected.\n3. Captain of Debate Club, 9th place at my state debate tournament after joining in my junior year. Led coaching program for new debaters.\n4. Founder of World Awareness Club, discussing emerging events and examining history of oft-overlooked nations. Designed weekly presentations on various topics.\n5. We The People Constitutional Law Team: Placed second in state for unit group. Earned team most valuable contributor award. Selected to return as coach for senior year.\n6. Co-leader of Philosophy Club. Designed weekly presentations and led discussions about philosophical issues. Built club from 0 to 12 members.\n7. Chess Club: Played Boards 1 & 2 on state and county championship winning chess team. Placed 1st of 36 in school-wide chess championship. 99.9th percentile [chess.com](http://chess.com) rating.\n8. Schoolhouse Tutoring: 100+ volunteer hours as an online math tutor at Schoolhouse.world. Obtained all 15 available certifications from pre-algebra to multivariable calculus.\n9. 2x Varsity Cross Country: Won coach\u2019s award for outstanding improvement and inspiration of teammates. Helped team to qualify for first ever state open. 18:03 5k.\n10. Niche sport: started competing senior year, overall mediocre achievements but decent for 1yr of play. letter of support from Harvard coach.\n\n**AWARDS:**\n\nNational Merit Scholarship Semi-Finalist,  \nUS Presidential Scholar Nominee  \n$1000 political essay contest,1st/83  \n$500 political essay contest, 1st/50+ by unanimous decision of 20 judges  \nSemi-Finalist in constitutional law competition involving spending 200+ hours preparing and defending a legal brief.  \nMinor poetry competition, top 5 out of 500 (only submitted this because I've written a lot of poetry just for personal reasons and wanted to show my interest in poetry somewhere on my app).\n\nLetters of Recommendation:\n\n- **We The People Coach & Debate Advisor, 10/10**:   \n  \nI functionally did more than half of the work for my We The People team of 13 kids during my junior year because I was really interested in the subject. There were a lot of academic/socioeconomic disparities in the class, and I tried to help everyone feel more included and excited about learning the material and to teach people what I could from the research I was doing. I worked a lot with my teacher to try to do this, and he really appreciated. I also did a lot of extra competitions and reading relevant to the subject because I really enjoyed it. I also returned to coach in his class and have done a lot to try to promote the We The People program, which is sort of dying at my school.  \n  \n- **English teacher: 8/10.**   \n  \nThis was a discussion-based class, and I always tried to contribute in the class because I loved the things that our teacher would select for us to read. My teacher gave me a 100 on basically every assignment in his class and thought I was really insightful and interesting, so this should have also been pretty good.  \n  \n- **My African business partner: 10/10.**   \n  \nHe's worked with me almost every day for 3 years and was able to give some perspective about how we met, how we came up with the idea together in order to try to help people in his country, and how hard I've worked to try to navigate the technical and cultural challenges of the business. I submitted this everywhere that allowed me to submit a supplemental recommendation from a non-teacher, so everywhere but MIT/Georgetown.  \n  \n**Peer rec: 9/10.**   \n  \nMy best friend throughout high school was my debate partner and in my We The People group. He told me that he talked about the ultimate frisbee and trivia events we sometimes organize with friends and emphasized how I'm knowledgeable and a good friend.\n\n- **Physics teacher: 6/10**, only for MIT because they ask for a STEM teacher rec.  \n  \n I was not very talented in physics and had to work extremely hard to eventually get good at the class and get an A+, and I worked a lot with my teacher who liked me. But I don't think that this teacher would be very good at writing recs if I had to guess, and he would be lying to say I was an exceptionally talented student in his class.\n\n- **Counselor, 9/10:**   \n  \nMy counselor is amazing and helped me work through adapting as a homeschool kid, learning how to play the game of school, and skipping multiple classes every year. She was always really nice to me, even though she was firm and made me stay on target. I knew her much better than most people know their counselors at my school, so I think this was probably good.\n\n**Essays: 8/10.**\n\nI'd say that writing is one of my best skills, and I had a lot of different aspects of my life to talk about. I ended up writing over 100 supps, many with multiple iterations, and I became a psychotic essay-writing machine by the end of my process, able to immediately start writing a personal essay about any prompt. Sometimes I had no idea whether I was being genuine or not.\n\nMy essays mostly emphasized my unique homeschooling background growing up in an extremely odd family (my dad is 80, for instance), how that led me to become interested in working internationally and improving people's lives, and how I hope to pursue college programs that will help me develop the skills I'll need to develop an international career at the next level of scale. I write a lot of poetry and wrote some of the more quirky or open-ended ones in a poetic tone, but I generally tried to just emphasize the most interesting picture of myself that I could.\n\nI left additional info in my app that basically told Princeton and Yale that I'd rather go to Dartmouth.  I'm guessing that got my autorejected, but to be fair I would rather go to Dartmouth, so it's okay! My best essays were for MIT, Northwestern, UChicago, Dartmouth, and Stanford. My worst were for JHU, Princeton, Michigan, and Tufts. My Yale essays were so bad that I might as well have not submitted them. My personal statement for UK schools was far too American-style and didn't emphasize enough about what I did in class, which I thought I could get away with, but it was a mistake. Don't be like me.\n\n**Interviews**:\n\nMy business requires me to do a lot of networking and be good at 'selling the idea of myself,' so I think I'm pretty good at interviews in general by now. Debate has also made me a more confident public speaker. As you'll see, I don't really think that interviews are that important.\n\n**Dartmouth**: 10/10! My interviewer was an extremely nice recently retired lady with a daughter at Dartmouth. We spoke really deeply for an hour and a half about my life, basically everything of note I've ever done in high school, and how I came to care about the things I do. She was really interested in my business and my political work, and we had a really insightful conversation that I still think about regarding it. She said that she thought I was \"different from other kids in a really good way\" and that she \"knew I was going to change the world.\" We also talked about Dartmouth, and she really gave me an amazing impression of the school. Honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met and I'm sad that I'll probably never get to speak to her again.  \n**Georgetown**: 10/10! My interviewer had experience working to reconstruct the Rwandan judiciary system after the genocide, something I've spent a lot of time reading about and researching. We had an amazing conversation about all my work and his interests, and he really sold me on Georgetown being a really good place for me. He said that he \"was going to write me a really positive recommendation\" and that I made him glad that he was an interviewer. I really loved this conversation and learned a lot from it.  \n**MIT**: 8/10. Talked about a lot of super cool stuff with the interviewer and was able to talk about some of the more interesting technical areas of my business with him. He told me that he could \"really see me at MIT,\" which almost made me laugh because I basically knew I wasn't getting in. Glad I met this guy though - he was an ocean engineer, super cool stuff! I didn't even know that was a thing.\n\n**Harvard**: 6/10, was able to convey my passion and interest in development economics, and we both connected over being able to speak Zulu! But my interviewer did ask me some questions about my family that I wasn't 100% comfortable with (why I have so many siblings, why my parents are so old, etc) that probably led her to think of me as a bit eccentric and odd.  \n**Princeton**: 7/10: Overall pretty good, interviewer was really impressed by my interests, but there was nothing outstanding enough to make me think I had any shot at Princeton.\n\n**Berkeley GMP Recorded Q&A:** 7/10. The GMP supplemental application was due at 2:59 AM my time. I started it at 1AM my time, right after having finished spending 7 hours submitting a different application. I started recording this interview at 2 fucking 40 AM. You get three \"takes\" of answering the questions with no time limit between them, so obviously the best strategy is to spend some time planning after you figure out what the questions are and trying for the first time, but I literally did not have enough time and had to submit my second take at exactly 2:59 while adrenaline coursed through me. I had good answers to the relatively standard questions from my experience writing so many supps, though, so I think it was actually okay in the end!\n\n**Yale**: 6/10: Interviewer was a psychologist who I felt was trying to psychoanalyze me in a somewhat condescending way? At the end of the interview, she said that she wanted to 'congratulate me on possessing an extremely impressive ability to do many types of work.\" When I spoke about my difficulties adapting to the social environment of public school as a homeschooler, though, I was talking about how I always take initiative to invite people I feel are being left out now that I'm perceived as socially normal and have a group of friends. She asked me \"Does anyone ever invite you to anything?\" which was honestly the biggest L I took this entire college process. I had to stop myself from laughing right there because it felt like she was trying to own me there lmao. No idea what her report might have looked like, but I already laughed when I got a Yale interview because of how bad my app was, so I didn't sweat it.\n\n**Duke**: 4/10. My interviewer showed up 90 minutes late and didn't ask me a single question. He basically asked me to just tell him what I wanted him to write down on the recommendation, and it was super hard to do anything other than just talk about my activities, which were obviously already on my application. Tried to avoid the interview ending quickly by asking him a bunch of questions about Duke, but I got the sense he wanted to leave because it was so late (apparently his kid had kept him busy with something and made him late).  \n**Penn Huntsman**: 3/10: My interviewer had a ton of super interesting experience that is super relevant to what I'd like to do, but she basically only asked me questions quizzing me on how much I knew about the Huntsman program and the interview was apparently capped to 30 minutes. I guess I more or less passed the test-like questions, but I can't imagine this added anything to my application. This is how basically everyone I know who had a Penn interview feels about theirs, though.  \nCornell: Non-evaluative interview. Asked some questions about campus and learned some stuff. Wasn't asked any questions about myself.\n\n**Results:**\n\n**UK Schools** (Applied to all for philosophy, politics, and economics combined major):\n\nOxford and Cambridge: Did not apply. **FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN OXBRIDGE, PLEASE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TESTS YOU MUST SIGN UP FOR IN ORDER TO APPLY, WHICH HAVE SIGNUP DEADLINES MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE DEADLINE.** Nobody told me :(  \nLondon School of Economics: Denied  \nUniversity of Edinburgh: Accepted  \nUniversity of Exeter: Accepted  \nUniversity of Durham: Accepted  \nUniversity of Warwick: Withdrew application\n\n**Early applications:**  \nHarvard REA: Deferred -> Denied  \nMichigan EA - Deferred - Waitlisted  \nUConn - Accepted, Honors Program, $7500/year scholarship offer.  \nMcGill College of Arts and Sciences: Accepted\n\n**Regular decision applications:**\n\nNorthwestern: Waitlisted  \nBoston University: Denied  \nTufts: Waitlisted  \nGeorgetown: Waitlisted  \nJHU: Waitlisted - Accepted for some reason (no loci)  \nVanderbilt: Denied  \nMIT: Denied  \nUChicago: Waitlisted  \nPrinceton (International relations): Denied  \nYale: Denied  \nStanford: Denied  \nColumbia: Denied  \nPenn Huntsman Program in International Business: Denied  \nBrown: Waitlisted  \nUVA: Accepted  \nCornell School of Industrial & Labor Relations: Accepted. ILR has a \\~18% acceptance rate, which is really cool considering that it's a great fit for my interest in recruitment.  \nDartmouth: Accepted!!! Absolutely love the culture and campus environment at Dartmouth  \nDuke: Accepted!??! Honestly could not tell you why this was, with how rare Duke RD acceptances are at my school and with my essays/interview being unexceptional. The fact that the one researcher in the world that is currently researching outsourcing in Africa happens to be an undergrad prof at Duke, and that I was able to cold email him and get advice from him and mention him in my essays, probably helped.\n\n**UCs:**\n\nQuick note for UC apps - second choice majors are not given equal consideration at many UCs. Most of them say that they \"only guarantee the review of first-choice majors,\" which in practice means that they admit by major and if your second-choice major is relatively in demand, it'll probably be full by the time they get around to reviewing second-choice applicants, and at best you'll be competing for a very small number of spots. This wouldn't have personally changed what I applied to, but it's most likely why I didn't get into econ at UCSD/UCSB, and it's worth checking the second-choice major policy of any UC you apply to before you decide.  \nUCSD (Computer science, second choice econ): Waitlisted  \nUCSB (Computer science, second choice econ): Denied  \nUC Davis: Accepted  \nUCLA: Accepted  \nUC Berkeley: Accepted for global management program!! Can't believe I got into this honestly, especially with it being test blind - they have a \\~1.5% acceptance rate for only 30 spots and it's a super cool international business program that has a lot of travel opportunities and is a great fit for my interests.\n\n**Conclusions**:\n\nVery torn between Berkeley, Dartmouth, Duke, and Cornell at the moment. Currently leaning towards Berkeley, for how amazing the GMP program is in various ways and proximity to Bay Area startup culture, and Dartmouth, for the more relaxed vibe, better access to less competitive research opportunities, and the fact that my sister lives nearby. I can honestly see arguments for all four, though, and I'm planning to visit all four soon and totally open to suggestions!\n\nI hope reading this posts, which represents the culmination of the ridiculously stupid amount of effort I put into this process at various times, is interesting to you guys, and I hope it can teach some people something! I will say that while I'm very satisfied with these results, I don't really feel the sense of elation or relief that I sort of hoped would 'bail me out' of the endless grind to do things. There are still aspects of myself I'm not happy with, and there are new goals that I constantly feel I'm not doing enough towards, like growing my company. Oh well, looking back, I'm proud of the way that I developed in high school. It wasn't easy. It's never easy."

I've seen a lot of my peers drop thousands of dollars on external counselors and what not end up with worse results than me. It's really apparent to see the difference in results between a kid who the teachers love gassing up, and a kid who the teachers don't care for all that much (even if they have decently strong stats).\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy Common App was basically how I started extracurricular 1, going deep into community building, team building, creating a global impact, learning Java from knowing nothing, and even branching out to other diverse projects.\n\nMy supplements mainly revolved around open-source activism, interactions within the global open-source community, how Lord of the Rings got me interested in conlangs and eventually linguistics, computational linguistics and operating systems research, how I became a polylinguist, as well as a story about the chaos theory research paper.\n\nThe more fun supplements had several varied topics like post-punk and shoegaze rock, grunge aesthetics, epistemology, Hot Wheels dioramas, Pokemon fan-game development, and Charli XCX (these aspects were not included in any of my early essays, my RD applications were when I decided to not take myself too seriously and some of these changes were also in my new Common App essay for RD).\n\nI didn't try to game my essays at all. I knew I couldn't in any sense depict myself as unfortunate or disadvantaged, or depict myself as so incredibly impressive that I need to be on the cover of Time Magazine right now. In fact, all of my diversity essays were about being an open-source activist and the appreciation I have for pushing forward Richard Stallman\u2019s ideals and works, and had quite literally nothing to do with my own social standing. I kept it simple and true to myself and what I really want to do and what I liked about these individual universities and communities I'm already involved in. While I seemed kind of doubtful doing this and not just doing some cliched \u201clife experience that forever changed me\u201d essay, my results show me that I never had to go into those paths. If you love a fairly niche intellectual topic like that, lean into it. It's possibly the best \u201chook\u201d you can have as an otherwise fairly generic applicant.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nPenn: Lasted for about an hour. Nothing particularly noteworthy happened. I pretty much regurgitated whatever was on my supplements with more detail but also got points from supplements that Penn didn\u2019t ask for. After that, about 30 minutes of the conversation was about how powerful Penn\u2019s network is and him mostly gassing up Penn and me asking about the American lifestyle (somehow the topic steered into this). Overall the interview was not even close to academic but was more about how to build connections at Penn and how it\u2019s important to attend all events and to stand up and seize opportunities (which I guess is really what Penn is about at the end of the day).\u00a0\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n_Rolling:_\u00a0\n\nUT Dallas (CS): Accepted (4k/semester Academic Excellence Scholarship)\n\nASU (CS): Accepted (13.5k/yr University Scholarship)\n\n_ED:_\n\nCornell (CS @ CoE): Rejected\n\n_ED 2:_\n\nCMU (SCS): Deferred -> Waitlisted\n\n_EA:_\n\nU-M Ann Arbor (CE @ CoE + SI): Accepted\n\nUNC-Chapel Hill (CS): Accepted\u00a0\n\nUMD College Park (LTSC): Accepted\u00a0\n\nUW Madison (CE @ CoE): Deferred -> Accepted\n\nGeorgia Tech (CS): Deferred -> Waitlisted\n\nUSC (CS @ Viterbi): Deferred -> Rejected\n\nUIUC (CS @ Grainger): Rejected\n\n_RD:_\n\nUCLA (CS): Accepted\n\nUCSD (Undeclared): Accepted\u00a0\n\nUCI (CS): Accepted\u00a0\n\nJohns Hopkins (CS): Accepted\n\nHarvey Mudd (CS): Accepted\u00a0\n\nColumbia (CS @ Engineering): Waitlisted\n\nUC Berkeley (EECS): Waitlisted\n\nStanford (CS): Rejected\n\nYale (CS): Rejected\n\nPrinceton (CS B.S.E.): Rejected\n\nHarvard (CS): Rejected\n\nPenn (CS @ SEAS): Rejected\n\nCaltech (CS): Rejected\n\nMIT (CS): Rejected\n\n_Committed:_\n\nUCLA (CS @ Samueli Engineering)\n\n**Additional Thoughts**\n\nGrateful, just that.\n\nI never wanted to leave the country until early-12th grade, so I was hoping that my presence in open-source development would carry me because I never bothered trying summer programs, fellowships, research programs, non-profits, really committing to Olympiads or whatever else people do for top 10 colleges until the early 12th grade (and by then it was too late for me to have done any real fulfilling work that transcends my open-source development, but I still managed to do quite a few things and I will say that the 12th grade was pretty hectic). It's pretty funny that I skipped multiple online classes in 9th grade just to work on extracurricular 1 as a hobby I was completely obsessed with that my mom wasn\u2019t really a fan of, and now it's my main extracurricular for college.\n\nThe SOF Academic Excellence Scholarship is the only prestigious SOF award as it doesn\u2019t have ties and it\u2019s a public table on their website locked at 240 winners per year. Most of my open-source work and awards took upwards of 5 years to attain from 6th grade, which I talked about in my essays (August 2021 was when my work blew up and became popular). It ramped up in the 9th grade when I had time to do more things due to the lockdown, so I\u2019m not sure what my extracurriculars would\u2019ve looked like if the lockdown hadn\u2019t happened (I\u2019m not sure if I would\u2019ve even considered applying to the US). Still, I feel like I could've done a lot more and a much better job if I had definite plans earlier, and this regret weighed on me quite a bit through 2023.\n\nI will admit that the prestige was part of the allure for me, probably why I shotgunned this much. I don\u2019t regret shotgunning per se, because most of the work was done by January 5 itself, and I do recommend shotgunning to internationals. The ED1 blow made me more hesitant to apply to fewer universities in RD, as I really wanted to go to the US. But honestly, I came more to terms with maybe not going to the US after ED1 day. Having IIIT Hyderabad CS (a T5 for CS in India basically) as a backup from the Linguistics Olympiad camp qualification kind of comforted me through this phase. Getting into U-M Ann Arbor EA quickly put those worries to rest, even if it was pretty momentary (it's pretty much a T5 to me based on research in NLP + operating systems).\n\nProbably important to note, my EA and ED1 essays were highly technical to the point that I assume only people within the communities I'm in would understand some of the terms I used (huge oversight). I did a complete rewrite for RD of pretty much everything from the Common App essay and extracurricular descriptions to my supplemental formats. They were much more ethics and society-oriented, with way more emphasis on collaboration, being a global citizen and polylingual, and how many people I've worked with from around the world. The technical aspects of the essays were also a lot more thoughtful about their impact and had just a few technical terms sprinkled in instead of being outright expository. Most of my supplementals were reused all over the place, except Caltech where I went technical but in a different way than I did earlier.\n\n90% of these things were done when I was still considering just studying in India (except the APs, SAT, and TOEFL), so I'm glad that all of them came around to be professionally useful to me. Y'all can connect with me on LinkedIn if you want to talk (just search up any extracurricular, I would probably show up).\n\n**Advice**\n\nAll the things I regretted I never did, I never needed. These results are already pretty satisfactory to me, and honestly feeling upset that I never did things I\u2019ve never even heard of before seems kind of silly to me now. Do what you want to do, it\u2019ll always help you in the end. My extracurriculars in operating system development and linguistics are fairly niche for an international, but it\u2019s exactly what I can stay up all night and all day and do. Make sure you like what you\u2019re doing. You probably won\u2019t regret not doing enough in your high school life as much then.\n\nI learned about this pretty late into the admissions cycle (as in just before RD so maybe not too late): the AOs who read your application almost always skew humanities. Do not assume that they understand what the Linux kernel is, that they understand how significant authoring multiple merged commits in FAANG repositories is, or that they understand terminology like forks, branches, and workflows. Explain like you would to a friend at school who isn't 100% sure what your work is about, not like to a person you're working with within these STEM fields. This was the major mistake in my early applications\u2019 extracurricular descriptions and essays.\n\nThird, I hear this a lot from several people on Reddit, but it is completely true. I assumed a year ago that college admissions would be all in my head during this time, and I would feel like I\u2019ve finally closed the chapter on 4 years of my life when I get into something like a T3 state flagship. But it isn\u2019t true, your feelings don\u2019t work that way.\u00a0\n\nThe people who value college prestige are also the type to value success as the end of their sufferings. Unfortunately, you won't find happiness through success, because you'll never always be successful.\n\nMake sure you don\u2019t succumb to senioritis. My grades dipped from the 11th-grade finals to the start of 12th grade and then slowly grew again, from 86% in the half-yearly (which was never reported anywhere thankfully) to finally climbing up to 94% by preboard 2.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m feeling fairly optimistic about my board results too (would be comfortably higher than my predicted score because that score was based on a formula that gave way too much weightage on the half-yearlies which I did pretty terribly), but I know I slacked at the start of the year. Of course, as an international, it\u2019s hard to keep up with all of these things going on together, particularly because our curriculum is not designed to also give you time to do extracurriculars, standardized tests, and write essays. But that\u2019s just how it is; you\u2019ll have to learn how to handle it.\u00a0\n\nHave fun. I attended like 2 parties this year (OMG THATS SO MANY WOWO). Honestly, I regret skipping out on so many kickback and relax events throughout the year, considering that attending would have had pretty much 0 impact on my college applications. You win some, you lose some. Make sure you have fun. I know I did, but sometimes I wonder how things would\u2019ve been if I had done more.\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t lose yourself in the college rabbit hole that you\u2019re starting to have conversations with yourself about how you\u2019d handle a specific tough course in the third year of college at a specific university when you haven\u2019t even received decisions there yet.\u00a0\n\nGoing out with friends would've taken 4 hours. Learning about Professor Kruskal from UMD\u2019s lore on Reddit and discovering there's a soundboard of out-of-context quotes by him out there would also occupy you for 3 hours. One is pointless as there's a possibility you'll not attend UMD anyway, while the other would've given you memories you could cherish for life.\n\nLive in the moment. Look forward to the future, but don\u2019t dwell on the future forever.\n\ngood luck xxx\n"

(heck some ppl ik alr crashed in senior year)\n\nalso FIND GOOD HIGH SCHOOL COMPANY. you really are the average of the five ppl ur with. my friends really did push me to become a better person and achieve things i never thought i could do.

(7/10)\n* EA Supplementals: These were pretty garbo. I think I wrote one good supplemental in the whole EA process. I'm pretty sure I got rejected form UIUC just because of my essays. idk how tf I got into Purdue since I wrote their essays in like 40 mins.

I knew it wasn't in my favor but I still had hopes. I didn't really realize how competitive and how much of a blood bath this process is until after going through it. I think my biggest mistake was how 1 dimensional I was. My PS was very one dimensional and my ECs are very one dimensional. I wish I tried exploring different things throughout HS and kinda went hard into something that wasn't just CS. At the end of the day, I can't change anything, but I can only learn from it. At the end of the day it's whatever. I'm really happy to have bagged both UT and Purdue. They're both great schools for my major and I honestly can't complain when I have both of them. Rejection hurts, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. I'm gonna try and keep the idea of \"rejection is redirection\" (as corny as it is) in my head because I do think there is some truth to it. There must have been a reason why I wasn't accepted into any of my far reaches and I might not know know but I'm confident it's for the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyways, **#UTAUSTIN2028** AND **HOOK 'EM \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd**"

My SAI according to FAFSA is -1500 and I qualify for the full Pell Grant, but I'm expecting to get a wild range of different financial aid packages. I ended up shotgunning a crazy number of schools to hedge my bets that there'd be a couple that'd offer me much better aid than the others, since net price calculators varied a lot for pretty much all the schools. I applied to international schools partially for shits and giggles, but mostly because they're cheaper at sticker price than a lot of US schools, and I wasn't sure if I'd get any aid at all in the US anyway.\n\nSome fun number-crunching: my overall acceptance rate was 51%, and 38% when not counting safeties. My US-only acceptance rate was 48%, and 29% when not counting safeties. My US public school acceptance rate was 83% percent, compared to my US private school acceptance rate of just 13% (both of which were safeties!). My New England acceptance rate was 30%, compared to a West Coast acceptance rate of 75%. The total of all my merit aid offers was $476,000.\n\n**Tentative Commitment Decision:** >!UC Berkeley \u2014 my parents are selling our house to pay for it!<"

I also got into 4 reaches which I feel really grateful for. However Ivy day was really a massacre :( - 8 rejections in a row (7 ivies + duke). Harvard was my number 1 choice and my friend got in, but I didn't, which kind of hurt by since we are similar caliber students, but I am happy for them. I assume it was because these ivies only wanted to take one student max from our school, and Harvard didn't even give me an interview so they probably chose my friend over me pretty early on.\n\nLooking back on everything now, I believe there were a few things I could have done differently (maybe I would have done even better?). However, I don't really have any complaints. This is just my thoughts so anybody reading this can learn from my mistakes.\n\nFirst, I probably shouldn't have shotgunned this hard and applied to 30 schools. If I had cut some schools (maybe down to 20-25), maybe my supps would have been more tailored to each program. However I don't blame myself as back then I was honestly nervous that I was getting in nowhere.\n\nSecond, I got a B+ and 2 A-s in S1 senior year, leading to a downward trend in my GPA. This probably looked bad as before this I had only one A- in my entire high school career. With better course selection this could have been avoided.\n\nThird, I messed up some of my teacher relationships in junior year. Originally, my english teacher was going to write a letter for me, but I ruined my relationship with her and couldn't ask in the end. So, I had to ask my history teacher who didn't know me nearly as well.\n\nFourth, I think I was a pretty late bloomer and didn't start grinding for college until late sophomore year. If I had started earlier I would have had so much more time to do things and the stress of application season would have been less intense. Starting early is super important as it gives you more time to do what you need to do (but don't start in middle school, please).\n\nOverall I believe my rejections from the ivies / hypsm may have been influenced by any combo of these factors (or maybe just bad luck and the hypercompetitive nature of these schools). I would say that I didn't have any red flags, as my stats, ecs, and essays were definitely good enough to contend for admission. I also didn't do ED or REA, because I didn't believe my essays were ready. Doing ED or REA may be the move if I had to do it over again.\n\nLastly, as an asian male (especially in stem), perfect stats and strong ecs (meaning NATIONAL AWARDS) are probably the benchmark, and even messing up a tiny portion of them could lead to failure. The best way to stand out if you have the stats and ecs is probably extremely polished supplemental essays and super stellar recs. I would also say the theme of your application is important too. It is crucial to appear well rounded and spiked at the same time.\n\nI will most likely commit to Hopkins, and I am visiting on Blue Jay days next week!\n\nedit: rejected by stanfordalso, many people have told me to consider northwestern so i will try to visit during wildcat days!"

decent relationship, i participated a good amount in class and did awesome in class, put good effort into our projects. they also sponsored one of my clubs\n* CS Teacher (7/10) - had for two years, put in a lot of effort in both classes, but never talked to them too much. sponsored a couple activities i was part of but nothing too intense. i liked them but it is awkward to interact with them\n* Director of volunteer org from activity #1 (7/10) - never met irl, only talked to a few times but hopefully spoke to my efforts especially since high school volunteers are rare\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* Stanford (6/10): nothing exciting. asked a lot of boring, cliche interview questions. nice person but didn't learn anything about Stanford. knew some of the local political stuff i was involved with though\n* MIT (9/10): super good ngl. she asked me a lot of follow-up questions about AI and it was very mentally stimulating. couldn't see her face but she seemed to like my answers and we shared some common interests\n* Princeton (8/10): it was in-person unlike the others so much more personal. didn't ask me a lot of questions but seemed to like my answers even though they were cliche. learned a whole lot about Princeton which was cool. and we had some common interests and back and forth convo.\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Common App Essay: wrote about the pandemic and a family emergency and how they developed my passions and changed my outlook on life. lowkey mid essay i wish i tried harder\n* Supplementals: i worked really hard on most of these, and i would say many of them were really good. ultimately, i don't think it made a huge difference which is unfortunate but i had a good time figuring how to express myself and my values and such\n\n**Decisions**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* >!U of Pittsburgh (rolling)!<\n* >!Purdue (EA)!<\n* >!U of Southern California (EA)!<\n* >!U of Illinois Urbana Champaign (EA)!<\n* >!U of Maryland (EA)!<\n* >!U of Washington \\[ did not get my intended major cs \\]!<\n* >!UC San Diego!<\n* >!Boston U (RD)!<\n\nWaitlists:\n\n* Northeastern (RD)\n* UChicago (RD)\n* UCLA\n* Carnegie Mellon (RD)\n* Georgia Tech (Deferred EA)\n* UC Berkeley\n* Brown (RD)\n* Cornell (RD)\n\nRejections:\n\n* Stanford (REA)\n* Caltech (RD)\n* MIT (RD)\n* Johns Hopkins (RD)\n* Columbia (RD)\n* Princeton (RD)\n* UMich (Deferred EA) \\[ didn't do the loci so expected \\]\n\nAdditional info:\n\n* i submitted a music portfolio to almost all the schools that accepted it but it was pretty mid and i could've devoted more time to it, i didn't think it adequately represented my abilities\n\nReflection:\n\nin conclusion, the college application process is a cancer and you couldn't pay me to go through it again. please take care of yourself and make time for the things and people you love. finish out high school strong and enjoy going to school and learning. compartmentalize: don't work on or think about your applications even in your spare moments in class. you'll eventually start doing it when you're supposed to be paying attention. don't take a full schedule senior year if you plan to apply to a lot of colleges.\n\nmy results were really good but i was still hoping for more. i don't know what's going to happen with waitlists and such but we will see. at the end of the day i think certain passions/values are incredibly difficult to convey on paper. you know what you're worth but colleges can't possibly just based on the materials they get from you.\n\ni truly did what i could and i'm happy with the things i devoted my time to in high school (aside from a few bad decisions socially but that's neither here nor there). i couldn't have gotten better grades, better test scores, or even better ECs because i didn't do anything just for college admissions. if i were to analyze where i could possibly have improved my application, i can think of two main areas\n\n* i devoted A LOT of time to music activities and didn't see many returns in the form of achievements that would be impressive to colleges. i could have MAYBE spent this time doing research/more stuff related to my intended major. i say maybe because there's really no way of knowing what i would do with more time. also i read like 100 books in high school so like i could have made time by not doing that either or i could have just used my music time to read more books haha. either way, i wouldn't be the person i am without music and it's been one of the most enriching experiences of my life\n* i didn't build strong enough relationships with my teachers. i was an incredible student but for the most part did not make an effort to have a relationship with them because it just wasn't my personality to do so. i do think i could have built stronger relationships and been more conscious of the teachers i asked to write my recommendations instead of just picking the ones i thought colleges would like to hear from.\n\ni think it's pretty easy to lose sight of what's important in this process. learning is what i love and i'm going to continue that no matter what college i attend. this is just one day in a long life! honestly this process was kind of fun and exhilarating at times too\n\ni don't know if all this is too deep but i hope it's helpful to someone lol. happy to answer questions if you have any (also any advice on which school to pick would be helpful)"

just me talking about my favorite book on camera for like two minutes. idk if you can tell but i have a hard time taking the video introductions seriously (which is not an approach i would recommend, they can add to your application if you do them well!), and this may have reflected that.\n* **yale interview** \\- 10/10 amazing. ok well maybe not because i was a solid 20 minutes late, but my interviewer was very patient and very understanding and we had a great rapport pretty much right off the bat. he was an english major at yale and now teaches creative writing at a local university, so we talked a lot about books and literature and the amazing libraries at yale. we also talked about public art on campus, why i love math even though i suck at it, the state of high school education, and how he met anderson cooper one time in a swahili class. awesome guy, awesome interview. \n\n**essays**\n\n* **commonapp essay** \\- fondly referred to as the paperclip essay. i had a very difficult time coming up with a topic for a long time, so it may have been a little rushed, but i was pretty happy with how it turned out. i wrote about my obsession with paperclips and how it shaped my worldview. corny? yeah probably. predictably, boringly quirky? maybe. i stand by it though, because i love this essay.\n* **bowdoin** \\- wrote about my sick record collection! recycled essay, but not bad i think.\n* **brown** \\- wrote about the oxford comma, my record collection (again), my laptop stickers, moving a lot as a kid, cow tools, and speech and debate. these ended up getting done in one day, but i am actually really happy with how they turned out.\n* **macalester** \\- wrote about public transit, linguistic and cultural diversity, and speech and debate. this was in the early round, so i hadn't quite figured out how i wanted to approach the essays. as a result, these aren't my best lol.\n* **tufts** \\- wrote about cow tools (again) and connections between environmental studies, anthropology, and human communication. it was fun to write but not my best work. \n* **uchicago** \\- also early essays, also not great. wrote about how much i love puns for the uncommon essay i think. funny to me at the time, but not great looking back.\n* **umn-tc**, **uw-madison**, **uw seattle** \\- grouping these together because a. this is getting long and b. they were relatively similar essays. also all early essays, so not my best. i think i definitely talked too much about academics without actually showcasing anything about who i am as a person.\n* **yale** \\- similar to brown, i did write these all in one day. by that point i had figured out the kind of voice i wanted to have in essays, and i knew that it wasn't a voice achieved by a lot of editing. i had also figured out that i wanted to focus way more on little things about me as a person than on big-picture academic stuff, which i wish i had realized earlier tbh. anyways, wrote about a time i got stuck at the airport, queer poetry, cow tools (yes again), the alien movies, and speech & debate (yes, also again). \n\n**decisions**\n\n* **early action**\n   * university of minnesota - twin cities: accepted\n   * university of wisconsin - madison: accepted\n   * macalester college: accepted w/ $20k merit scholarship\n   * uchicago: deferred\n* **regular decision**\n   * university of washington - seattle: accepted w/ $4.2k merit scholarship\n   * uchicago: rejected\n   * colby college: waitlisted\n   * bowdoin college: waitlisted\n   * tufts university: waitlisted\n   * williams college: waitlisted\n   * oberlin college: accepted\n   * vassar college: accepted\n   * wesleyan university: accepted\n   * vanderbilt university: rejected\n   * brown university: rejected\n   * yale university: accepted!!!!!\n\n**additional information**:\n\n* will hopefully be committing to yale soon!! waiting on a few financial aid things to come through, but it's definitely my number one choice right now.\n* i got hit with a quadruple waitlist (colby/bowdoin/williams/tufts) on the same day after spending eight and a half hours finishing my hl math ia, which sucked big time, and right before leaving the country on a transatlantic flight. this is not really relevant but it's something i want to share because it feels symbolic of the emotionally tumultuous nature of this whole process.\n* i would not necessarily recommend applying to this many schools if you don't have to-- i have a lot of financial need and the overlapping section of the venn diagram between colleges with strong liberal arts and colleges that offer a lot of financial aid tends to be schools with low acceptance rates. i did make this list with that in mind. that said, there are some schools that i don't know why i applied to (particularly vandy + oberlin). be mindful of that when making your final list: it's okay to apply to a lot of schools, but not everywhere is a good fit for you!\n* ESSAYS ESSAYS ESSAYS!!!!!!! SO IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!! SO SO SO SO IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!! would highly recommend being willing to get a little silly with them! AOs at top schools aren't looking for good students, because pretty much all their applicants are good students. they're looking for interesting, curious people who are passionate about their communities and have hobbies outside of school, but who also just so happen to be good students. by the time you're applying, your academics are pretty much set in stone. you've shown them you're a good student, and you shouldn't spend your essays trying to prove it (which i have seen some people do in their supplementals). tell them about your interests, even if you feel silly. it'll pay off.

I really wanted to go to college outside of texas.\n\nMajor: Economics. I noted wherever I could that I am far more interested in public policy or academia than corporate finance or investment banking, as I think that set me apart from a lot of other applicants. I wrote my personal statement about my interest in the economy and how I want to make great contributions to its study and understanding.\n\nRank: 9/500 - UW/W: 97.5/101.5\n\nSAT: 1490 (1 attempt) 720 Math / 770 Reading (highest in school)\n\n9 APS, 3 OnRamps (UT College-level course), 2 Honors, all advanced classes where AP or OnRamps was not available at my school. Essentially max rigor except 1 class junior year.\n\nLetters of Rec:\n\nOnRamps US History teacher - I know she wrote something fantastic + personal, and I essentially always led discussion and helped other students as much as I could.\n\nAP Stats teacher - known him all my life. We used to do stage performances together for the kids at my old church.\n\nAP English teacher - We fs liked each other, though idk how much she could write about me aside from very social + extroverted nature.\n\nMy Mentor (see below)- LOVE THIS GUY. I\u2019m sure he wrote something very nice about me.\n\nDartmouth peer recommendation was my friend Maddox. We have a great relationship, and we\u2019ve taken a lot of APs together.\n\nExtracurriculars:\n\nMentored under retired Senior Portfolio Manager current professor for a year, met weekly to learn from him + work together to build a dividend-valuation based portfolio. This year, I\u2019m mentoring under an entire branch of a very large fixed income investment company. I meet with the heads of the research department, trading department, investor relations, and certain workers from each. I did this all on my own. I didn\u2019t use any school or familial resources.\n\nRecreational Leader at local assisted living home. I began as the regular bingo caller, but soon was allowed to create and host my own events for the residents. Had a close relationship with all of them. (5hrs/week)\n\nMulti-Instrumentalist - I play drums, guitar, and have 1000+ hours of experience working with synthesizers. I release + market my own music.\n\nWriter- I\u2019m always working on my writing; I\u2019ve released one fantasy novel and dozens of poems. I\u2019m working on my next one right now.\n\nPresident of Chess Club\n\nInvestor- managing the portfolio created between me and my first mentor, I\u2019ve doubled the S&P for three quarters straight. Our formula is fr cracked\n\nGame development- Fluent in JS, Lua, and decent with C#. I\u2019ve programmed 2 of my own games.\n\nChurch Leader- aforementioned religious service. I perform and lead activities for 20-50 kids maybe once or twice a month. Done this for like 8 years.\n\nInterviews in chronological order:\n\nMIT- In-person. Went very well. We got along and I gave off very sweet + social. Standard good interview.\n\nPenn- did NOT go well. The guy was very \u201cserious businessperson\u201d so we didn\u2019t match.\n\nRice- similar to Dartmouth. We talked a lot about theology and Christian life on campus.\n\nDartmouth - Absolutely amazing. Probably about as good as an interview could possibly get. She said I was a perfect fit for Dartmouth, and that she hadn\u2019t ever written as many notes for a candidate before.\n\nPrinceton- I kind of sold this one bc I was nervous and it was over the phone (so I couldn\u2019t see their face, made me less confident)\n\nEssays: Personal statement is fine to weak, supplementals are usually great. (Particularly for Yale/Princeton/rice they were awesome.)\n\nNote: I continually changed and improved my application from summer to January. My worst applications were UT, Penn, and UTSA, and my best were Yale, Princeton, and Rice.\n\nMy colleges:\n\nUTSA (accepted with half ride and honors)\n\nUT Austin (rejected McCombs/finance but accepted Econ)\n\nUMich (Ross) (waiting)\n\nMIT (Course 15) rejected \n\nNorthwestern (Lots of demonstrated interest) rejected\n\nDartmouth rejected \n\nRice Waitlisted!\n\nYale rejected\n\nPrinceton rejected\n\nPenn (ed) rejected\n\nComments: I mean, obviously I\u2019m dissapointed. I really liked rice and Dartmouth and I think I would be much happier and fit in much better at those schools compared to ut. I also wish that I got into UT of my own merit instead of just their obligation to accept me. Idk. I did what I wanted to in high school so I guess at least I enjoyed it up until this year. I wish I know what I did wrong."

        "post": "Let's do this, shall we? My reflection/thoughts are at the end.\n\nDemographics: White male from Michigan, no hooks, live in a relatively rural area\n\nIntended major: Political Science/Government/Business depending on school\n\nAcademics: 4.0 UW/\\~4.5W, IBDP with 4 HLs (also 3 APs sophomore year). No class rank. \n\nStandardized testing: 1590 (800M, 790E). Actually got this score both times I took the test (consistency is key). Got a few 5s on my AP exams, also submitted a 6 in IB GloPol SL FWIW. \n\nAwards: \n\n1. National Merit Semifinalist\n2. College Board Rural/Small Town Recognition\n3. Best Delegate at big/prestigious MUN conference\n4. Best Delegate at smaller/less prestigious MUN conference\n5. Local NHS commendation\n\nECs: \n\n1. MUN: club VP as a senior and Treasurer the year before (+a LOT of Best Delegates, I literally didn't lose a conference one time, I was a god-tier delegate lowkey)\n2. NHS (Officer for three years, ran quite a few things in our 200-member org, 150+ hrs of service)\n3. Student Council President (self-explanatory, raised a lot for charities and the like)\n4. Student Representative on City Council (really cool experience, could talk about in interviews)\n5. Varsity Soccer (three years; didn't play because of COVID freshman year. Captain/District champion in Senior year, so pretty successful.)\n6. Student Advisory Board for my HS\n7. Forensics (actually got 8th in the state the one year I did it)\n8. Orchestra/Cello Performance (section leader in our top orchestra for 2 years)\n9. Quiz Bowl Captain\n10. Job as a counselor @ a local camp\n\nEssays: They were definitely good. I spent a LOT of time on them. Very concise, but sent strong messages relating to my interests. I was particularly proud of my Common App. I'm not rating because self-rating is impossible, but they 100% did not hurt my application.\n\nRecommendations: Incredible. I was lucky to have amazing teachers that adored me (for example, one said I was one of their best in decades and decades of teaching, and they know every top student at our school). Definitely a very strong part of my application.\n\nInterviews: Ranged from decent to very good. I'm a strong conversationalist, so generally I think they added some character to my app!\n\nAdditional Info: Mentioned my EE topic (related to politics). \n\nUpdate: Also updated colleges in late January with another MUN win, an essay contest win, and my US Presidential Scholar Candidate designation.\n\nResults:\n\nAccepted: UWisconsin, UNC, UVA (+ Echols Scholar), UMich (+ Ross + Regents Scholar), Georgetown, Columbia (with likely letter + admitted to CUSP program)\n\nWaitlisted: Harvard, Princeton, and Duke\n\nRejected: Yale (no interview, alright pal) and UPenn\n\nThoughts: I thought I was CRUSHING it until Ivy Day (mostly because I was). I clearly was qualified for a number of schools, it mostly comes down to luck. Top schools are truly a dice roll, and if I didn't get into Harvard because I didn't do the USSYP program, whatever! I know what the weaker parts of my app were, but I really exhausted every opportunity available to me in a town of 4,000 people, so I don't have any regrets. \n\nFurthermore, people told me I had no shot at Ivies with my ECs on a ChanceMe last year (hence the \"normal\" moniker I've applied to myself. I didn't do anything insane other than a) be really smart and b) be a good human). Please, however tempting it may be, do not use that subreddit. There is so much more to applications than what can be described here. Notably, I have a twin who got the exact same results with a very similar application.\n\nIf I could offer one piece of advice, BE A GOOD PERSON. It matters. It mattered for my recommendations, for the enthusiasm many had in supporting me through the process, for my own personal preparation for college, and for life itself. Colleges can tell. I promise.\n\nMy final choice is between UMich and Columbia (have thrown my name on the WL for Harvard and Princeton, but mostly for fun). The tuition discrepancy is enormous, so if you have any advice/thoughts, please PM me! I'm happy to answer any questions, too. "

NVIDIA). But I also want to be able to become a software engineer if I end up enjoying it more than the electrical engineering aspect in college (hence EECS major). In choosing a school, I want the university that will provide the best opportunities to build a successful career while also being able to be happy with the environment I am in (I saw the Princeton warning video https://youtu.be/pbfT1FIapzM?si=4xGbnaJ0y1RpGOu2 and am concerned). While I built a successful application and am passionate and willing to learn about computer science and engineering, I am extremely inexperienced and no doubt intimidated (but not discouraged) by such prestigious institutions. Any guidance will help, I understand rankings do not mean everything but those also further cloud a clear decision.\n\nPlease drop any useful information, advice, personal thoughts, or insights into these choices.\n\nThank you for your time."

I definitely would say I'm a people person so this worked to my advantage. I loved the school and had done a lot of research so my answers were very in depth.\n\nPrinceton: 3/10, she told me to ask her questions the whole time.

last day being a bit disappointed but not surprised since i didn\u2019t get into any of my reaches, and even tho i told myself rankings don\u2019t matter, it\u2019s hard to get rid of that internalized idea. at the end of the day tho berkeley pulled thru and i got my first (and only) reach acceptance \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 tbh i was so sure i wouldn't get in because i thought my GPA wasn't high enough but somehow i pulled cal???? so don't let redditors tell u your stats arent good enough, just try !!!!!\n\nlooking back at this whole process, i think i definitely got into my head abt everything and stressed myself out wayy too much. but honestly that was necessary for pushing myself (personally) to try and write the best essays i could and give this whole (terrible) process the best shot i have. while it didn\u2019t work out the way i thought it would, i am really happy with my results and i have some rlly good schools to choose between :)"

Was my chemistry teacher in grade 10 and 11. Super nice guy who was very enthusiastic about chemistry. Personally, I thought I was his favourite student due to being very inquisitive about the subject and also scrutinising certain concepts that were taught, which he appreciated a lot. Not a 10/10 just because idk what he actually wrote \n\nEconomics teacher: 9/10 someone who\u2019s known me for 4 years teaching me economics from grade 9 to 12. Super nice guy. Again probably favourite student since I\u2019ve been with him for a long time and he appreciates the effort I put in during class. 9/10 because seemed slightly superficial \n\nHead of School: 8/10. Pretty cool to get a letter from the HOS but he didn\u2019t really know me much personally other than the good grades and some things I had done at school. So the letter was weighty but didn\u2019t seem personal. Kind of just a paraphrasing of my resume but what did I expect\n\n**Interviews**\n\nDuke (originally ED but switched to RD): okay interview. Coincidentally she was a cardiologist at a big local hospital so we talked a lot about my paper. But she didn\u2019t seem super interested in doing the interview. But also it did go on for like an hour with her asking me to make another zoom link so we could continue talking \n\nPrinceton: Chill short interview. Guy was nice. Talked about my extracurriculars as a whole \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m a very quiet person when it comes to new people so my baseline for a \u201cgood\u201d interview would be much lower than other people \n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nPersonally thought this was one of the strongest parts of my application. Wrote an essay about my meticulous sleep routine and how sleep is something that made me interested in research while weaving in the extracurriculars that I do. Supplements were nothing crazy other than my long ones for UTA and UW-M that were about how me and oats (yes the grain) are alike \n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances: \nU of Oregon (18.5k merit + honors)\nOhio state (honors)\nCU - Boulder (6.25k merit)\nUConn storrs: 18.5k merit \nUF (6k merit)\nUMass Amherst (16.5k + study abroad)\nUW Seattle (4.3k merit)\nUMN TC (10k national scholarship)\nPurdue \nUW-Madison\n\n*Waitlists:* \nEmory \nDuke (no way)\n\n*Rejections:*\nUT-A (fucked me up)\nUNC chapel hill\nUVA\nDartmouth \nPrinceton \n\nFinal thoughts: Generally happy with my results but felt like I should\u2019ve applied to a couple more reach schools instead of like 6 safeties (can\u2019t blame me A2C and the crazy stats on this sub scared me). This was way more stressful than it should\u2019ve been and the two main things I would are \n1. Start early \n2. Take control of the process (don\u2019t let a parent/counsellor/third party dictate or even influence where you really want to go)\n"

They don't want a story; they want concrete information, information even barer than what you'd write for a PIQ, about either a special talent or a limitation - ex. how much time something took up, what opportunities you might have turned down because of something, what special things you accomplished in some obscure area and why they are special, etc.\n\nPlease, don't make the mistake I made and write them some long feel-good narrative about yourself. List the facts - and nothing else.\n\nMoving on, I'm really not sure whether I punched above or below my weight; I lean towards one or the other depending on my mood. I think I might have gotten better results had I applied to more universities, or spent more time on my essays, but there's no use in crying over spilled milk. Nevertheless, I really like - and am definitely excited to go to whichever one I end up picking - the colleges I got accepted to, though it would be nice to get another acceptance off a waitlist, as unlikely as that may be."

I started desperately preparing my application (writing all essays and stuff) in September while simultaneously making my grades better and prepping for the SAT. Miracles didn't happen and I got humbled as expected. I could afford USF and even ASU (which would be a little hard but feasible); however, I don't think 30-40k a year is worth it at these unis (they're good but they aren't Harvard). I will negotiate with Drexel and Bentley and ask for more money but the chances of success are low. I will accept the waitlist at Brandeis and Babson but only like 3% of those make it, which makes it impossible for me to get in. So now I have 3 options left for me.\r  \n\r  \nI could commit to ASU or USF even though it'll hurt our pocket.\r  \n\r  \nI can apply to the University of Amsterdam (which is around 35k a year but it is a 3-year education) and enroll there (I'm 75% sure I can get in)\r  \n\r  \nI can reapply as a Gap year student and just crash all my applications. See, the thing was that I had mid ecs and pretty bad written essays. I believe I can grind through the summer (do research (in economics or finance-related stuff), get an internship, and probably do a bunch of different projects). Retake the SAT (I am sure I can EASILY get a higher score) and take the ACT. Obviously, write better essays, and more thoroughly research unis. Also, my grades will be better (as I said, I'm finishing my senior year with a 4.0/4.0\n\nWhat do you suggest?"

I wrote about the stories I heard and encountered while taking care of the elderly and how I've begun making my own stories. I kept it as genuine as possible. My Yale AO said this made her tear up and I think it was a pretty sentimental piece. Initially, I was comparing my essay to those of people online and I was so worried because mine didn't look like theirs and I didn't start ec dropping and shit like them but honestly I had nothing to worry about. **Rating maybe: 9 (or 9.5?) / 10**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupplementals\n\nMy supps were def rushed but I would say these were really good as well. I kept them genuine and did my best to convey as many aspects of my character as possible. Compassion and diversity was a big theme for me loll. **Rating maybe: 8.5/10**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLORs\n\nI didn't see most of my LORs but I assume they were good. My calc teacher wrote how I was the best student he's had in years and my lang teacher talked about some classroom moments (forgot what exactly). **Rating maybe: 7 - 9 (crazy range ik) / 10**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interviews**\n\nTufts (9.5/10): Very chill and she calmed my nerves a LOT. It was like talking to another kid my age. Lasted like 40 minutes?\n\nHarvard (8/10): Almost very chill, was at starbucks. I messed up and stuttered a few times but overall this was very good. Lasted like 70 mins\n\nYale (10/10): We were both Black!! We talked a lot about the Yale environment and being a person of color on campus. Lasted like 80 mins\n\nPrinceton (9/10): One of my shorter interviews but he was sooo chill. He was a busy guy so our interview only lasted 20 mins but I was able to express myself pretty confidently and tell him why I liked Princeton.\n\nDuke (7/10): Ok my interviewer was lowk a bot bruh and the interview was p awkward. I didn't do enough research so when he asked me why Duke, I gave a vague answer and bro told me \"Well other schools have that too, what makes Duke different.\"\n\nURichmond Scholars (9.5/10): Even though it was in front of like 8 other people it was very chill. I was able to confidently talk about myself and what I'd like to do at Richmond\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DECISIONS**\n\n***Rejections:***\n\nUniversity of Miami (EA)\n\nBrandeis University\n\nNew York University\n\nBoston University\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Waitlists***\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Acceptances***\n\nDuke University\n\nYale University (likely letter)\n\nNortheastern University (EA)\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst (EA)\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Boston (EA)\n\nNorthwestern University\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nTulane University (Deferred EA > Accepted RD)\n\nEmory University\n\nTufts University\n\nUniversity of Richmond + Richmond Scholars full-ride (EA)\n\nHarvard College (likely letter)\n\nCornell University\n\nPrinceton University\n\nCase Western Reserve University (EA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thoughts + What I Think Helped Me Stand Out**\n\nSo, yall can probably look at my grades/ecs and realize that I'm not the most cracked applicant (I only took 4 APs!!!). My stats and ecs were definitely really good! but dawg I couldn't even place in my regional science fair. So many kids were better than me in terms of grades and ecs.\n\nBut, at the same time, I think in comparison to my school I really stood out with my SAT and grades. BUT ALSO, at the same time it wasn't just stats. My stats just put me into consideration. I genuinely think it was my ECs and essays that got me in. The way I framed my application around compassion and shit I was genuinely passionate about I think really shined through to my AOs and they liked that. I didn't lie about anything (except I might've miscalculated or rounded up some hours...). I wrote my essays just as I would during English class or irl. I didn't try to be someone I wasn't and genuinely did ecs I liked. (and I think yall should do the same!!!).\n\nThe college admissions process is draining. To those hs juniors or below looking at this. Start early. Take the SAT and do your best on it. In my honest opinion, DONT HAVE A DREAM SCHOOL. Fall in love with a good safety school. Write naturally and don't try to use big words to sound smart (it becomes unbearable trust me). And tbh just try your best. Yall got this :)"

It is the most prestigious of the schools I got in, I think. I may be overworrying about small things. I'll probably visit it sometime soon and if I absolutely hate it I'll think of a different school, but I'd love some more input here. Please.\n\nI said on my reverse-chanceme I'd apply to a CSU.

        "post": "**Demographics**\n\nGender: something in between\n\nRace/Ethnicity: wasian\n\nResidence: socal\n\nIncome Bracket: 100-150k/yr\n\nType of School: tiny private (grad class of 110)\n\nHooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): first-gen\n\nIntended Major(s): compsci/sociology\n\n**Academics**\n\nGPA (UW/W): 3.94/4.54\n\nRank (or percentile): N/A\n\n\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 2 Honors (couple freshman year classes) + 17 APs (everything my school could offer, I scored 5's on everything... except for Calc AB, and Chem) + 2 DE (Mass Comm + Computer & Info Tech)\n\nSenior Year Course Load: AP CSA, AP Calc BC, APUSH, AP Spanish/Language, AP Lit, AP Phys 1, AP Stats\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\nI took the SAT nine times. It's not worth it--my best scores were my first two attempts:\n\n1550 : 780R/770M\n\n1540: 760R/780M\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\nList all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.\n\n\\#1: City liaison for students; I represented the interests of all the students in my neighborhood and council district, voting on policy during board meetings and collecting data on stuff like the overall satisfaction with the curriculum and the areas around schools. Normally a pretty dang hard to position to get, but on the day where the council was deciding who was going to be appointed--and when me and the two others that were running had to give a speech--I was the only one that showed up. One person got sick, the other got into a car accident on the way there. I won by default.\n\n\\#2: Media director of a big cultural organization; I started off as a normal teeny tiny freshman volunteer at this big org that my friend was a part of and when every election cycle came around I kind of forced myself to run--the year after that I was treasurer and managed a bunch of funds for ad campaigns and events. I won the election the year after that for vice president, and then lost the bid for president the following year. I thought I was cooked, but got appointed by the executive committee to act as the director for all incoming/outgoing media for the group, whether it be news coverage, interviews, etc. This was a super volunteering focused organization, and we did a lot of COVID relief work especially right after lockdown got lifted.\n\n\\#3: Regional director for a nonprofit; I was going to start my own, but I didn't know what I was doing, nor how to get big enough to actually help people. I figured the best way to go about it was to instead join a different one. There were some members of the group in #2 that were a part of a nonprofit that raised money for the homeless, and I joined it hoping I could spend some time there during the summers or weekends. \"Yeah I'll volunteer when I can\" turned into something like 2,000 service hours over the span of three years, and by the end of it the nonprofit's president and board of directors put me in charge of a couple branches that were in the southern parts of the US. To be completely honest, I was entirely unqualified for the position, and when I was organizing fundraising efforts for Christmas, the entire operation fell apart and I'm pretty sure I'm losing the position soon. Tried my best and learned a lot though!\n\n\\#4: VALORANT. Yes, really. I play it a lot, and I talked about it in a lot of my essays. Very philosophical.\n\n\\#5: Taekwondo; I started when I was around 3 years old so by the time college apps came around, I already had a ton of stories to talk about and awards to flex for the AO's. I taught classes twice a week for around two years, with the students being anywhere from 6 to 20 years old. It was really rough at the start because I don't even really like talking to people, but it forced me to learn how to do that and how to teach. That was a big focus of any of the essays I wrote on Taekwondo, and also the philosophy behind the martial art.\n\n\\#6: Art. I draw anime women for money. It's my part time job.\n\n\\#7: Election campaigns baby!!!! I was in charge of sending out communications via email and letters to all of the candidate's constituents in the region, and worked with a team of about 15 to make it happen. The dude was running for district attorney, and he ended up winning, so it was pretty satisfying.\n\n\\#8: Just plain old volunteering. I went out every week into LA to serve food and distribute clothes to people who didn't have them. Out of all my time commitments, this is the one I had the most fun doing. Talked to a lot of people, got to know them, and see them improve over time. Genuinely awesome watching the people you're helping get better.\n\n\\#9: YouTube!!!!!!!! I have a VALORANT channel that I hate talking about and fight for my life to hide from my family. I make little satirical short videos that poke fun at the people who play the game and the updates that get rolled out, and it's a lot of fun learning how to edit and tame the YT algorithm. I started off getting like 10 views a video and absolutely no engagement, but had a video with nearly a quarter million views on it by the time college apps rolled around. Showed the video to my Harvard interviewer, and it probably killed my chances there. I don't think Harvard alums like VALORANT very much.\n\n\\#10: N/A, I only had 9\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n\\#1: 2 congressional awards, a silver and gold medal; mostly for COVID relief volunteering and time spent down in the city distributing necessities\n\n\\#2: A couple letters of thanks from my state for COVID relief work\n\n\\#3: Couple letters of thanks from my city for COVID relief work\n\n\\#4: My Taekwondo POOM 4 certificate which basically said I sold my soul for Taekwondo and was qualified to teach it now\n\n\\#5: 4 president's volunteer service awards ranging from bronze-gold certificates for COVID relief work\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nAP history teacher (7/10): Probably would have been the strongest rec I got, and a 10/10, but I didn't know how to ask for rec's yet and how they worked so when I asked her for one I did so over text........................ and she finished it in under a week. Didn't feel confident that she was able to put everything she wanted to say down on it in that time\n\nAP math teacher (9/10): On first name basis with him, he's super swag.\n\nAP science teacher (10/10): The GOAT of my school. She saw me struggle in bio and then get better at it over time, so I think she wrote about my redemption arc.\n\nHead of school (8/10): We talk a lot and he personally approved a lot of the club stuff that I did at the school. Unfortunately, he's super way high up in the school bureaucracy so I don't know if he necessarily knew as much about me like my actual teachers.\n\nDean (7/10): He doesn't know me at all. I don't remember off the top of my head why I asked.\n\nKorean consul (8/10): He had a lot to say about my volunteer work, and about my work ethic, but I'm not even going to pretend like that's why his rec was strong. He was literally working at the korean consulate here in LA, and that's why I think the rec is good.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT (7/10): It was okay. I suck at ending interviews, and it was made worse by the fact that after we said goodbye we walked in the same direction for 7 minutes.\n\nHarvard (3/10): I called him the wrong name four times.\n\nDartmouth (8/10): I wasn't even sure why I applied to Dartmouth at the beginning, but she genuinely sold me the idea of going to the school. We talked for a super long time and only stopped because she had to go to the next interview.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI was super disorganized and all over the place with my essays. I don't believe in copy pasting essays for another school's prompt and then tweaking it, so I genuinely spent time on each one building it from the ground up. Upside: all my essays were unique. Downside: By the time Ivies were due, I was turning in 2nd drafts.\n\nMy personal statement was about getting cancelled online. I did some funny business and paid for it.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* Princeton RD (Soc)\n* MIT RD\n* Cornell RD (Soc)\n* Carnegie Mellon RD (Soc)\n* UMich Ann Arbor EA (CS)\n* UCSD (CS)\n* UCD (CS)\n* UCLA (CS)\n* UCSB (CS)\n* UNC Chapel Hill EA (CS -> Required 1 year abroad)\n* Boston College RD (Soc)\n* Northeastern RD (Soc -> Required 1 sem Oakland)\n* Notre Dame RD (CS)\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\n* Wellesley RD\n* Northwestern RD\n* Dartmouth RD\n* Boston University RD\n* Tufts RD\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n* Stanford\n* Harvard\n* Columbia\n* Brown\n* Yale\n* UPenn\n* Vanderbilt\n* UC Berkeley\n* USC\n* Pomona\n* Harvey Mudd\n* Bowdoin\n* UCI\n* Duke\n* Rice\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nIf you couldn't tell already, I was a T20 shotgun + some. Do I recommend doing that? No. Do I regret doing that? No.\n\nUnfortunately though, it looks like the school I commit to will come down to money more than anything, because I got $0 in financial aid across the board :') the next month will just be constant appealing for me"

Honestly, I'm so happy I got into UT (even though it isn't like a2c level good), that was literally like the best case scenario no matter what since its like super close to home, cheap, it has a very good CS program, and I have a lot friends going there. my only advice for applicants is don't take advice from me since I didn't really get into good schools and be in state for a really good school for your major. also probably don't apply to 4 safeties lmao, I just applied to asu so i could get a W early and umn because it was free"

I got rejected/waitlisted from most of my schools in large part because I didn't really give their applications the time they needed. Focus on a few applications and really put your all into them.\n* Personal fit with a college with very, very important (if you're not insanely cracked, ofc). I'm fairly certain that the only reason I got into Williams was because the essay I sent them was funny enough (and demonstrated enough fit) for them to believe that I would be a good fit for their college. Similarly, I think I got admitted to MIT mostly because I demonstrated my fit for MIT in my application. Honestly, for MIT students, I think this is fairly common. There are kids who manage to sweep the ivies but get rejected from MIT, and there are kids who get accepted to MIT but get rejected from all the ivies; I'm the latter. And I think the main explanation for that is that MIT looks for some specific things that don't necessarily overlap with the profile that the ivies look for.\n* You need impact in your ECs. I did not. Summarily, I got rejected/waitlisted from most of the reach colleges I applied to. I suppose I could beat myself up for not doing as much as I possibly could in my high school career, but honestly? I wouldn't change anything I did during high school. I spent my time just fiddling around with my hobbies, sleeping a lot, reading manhwa. playing games and whatnot; not once did I bother spending my time doing things that I really didn't wanna do. I spent most of my time thinking about who I am, who I wanted to be, and just generally enjoying my time\u2014though I do admit that maybe I was a bit too lazy during my high school career. But still, if sweating my ass off during high school\u2014trying to be someone who I most certainly am not\u2014is what I needed to get into the ivies, then I sure as hell don't want to get into the ivies. And hey, I still got amazing results by the end of the process, so who gives a shit anyway? \ud83d\udd25\n\nUpdate: I got into Stanford \ud83d\udc80. So, yeah, I think that maybe I might have been over-reacting to getting rejected by the ivies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"

I've known her since elementary school and she's become nearly a second parent to me. She's seen me come super far since then and I know her rec letter was the best I could hope for.\n\nEnglish teacher: 8/10. Known her since freshman year, she likes me and probably had good things to say but nothing particularly impressive (unless I'm a lot better of a writer than I think I am).\n\n**Interviews**\r  \n\r\r\n\nPrinceton: 4/10. My interviewer graduated from Princeton before my parents were even born and he didn't seem really up to date with both the world and Princeton itself. He seemed nice but he talked about himself the whole time. He seemed to like me though.\n\nDartmouth: 7/10. Took forever to get the interviewer to set a date but it went well. Nothing particualrly remarkable but she asked a ton of questions about homeschooling, which I was very happy about because I was worried it would be a disadvantage. Lasted about 30 minutes.\n\nDuke: 8/10. My interviewer grew up near me and had a very similar career to what I want, so I learned a lot. She was able to answer my questions super well. The questions were pretty generic and weren't difficult, so I answered easily.\n\nHarvard: 10/10. Got along with my interviewer famously. Not sure how to really describe it other than we just vibed. It was pretty informal but it went very well. He told me I was a perfect fit for Harvard but to not get my hopes up.\n\n\r**Essays**\r  \n\r  \nPersonal statement: 7/10. I haven't had a super interesting life (that I'd be willing to put on an application) so I had nothing really grand to say but I did pretty well with what I had.\n\nSupplementals: 8/10. Re-used most of them at various schools but I had several people read over them and they thought they were fantastic.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\r  \n\r  \nAcceptances:\r  \n\r  \nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville (rejected honors program though, despite having better stats than a ton of people I know got admitted)\n\nVanderbilt!!!\n\nVassar\n\n\r  \nWaitlists:\r  \n\r  \nBrown (deferred ED, rejected RD)\n\nHarvard!!!!!!!!!\n\nCornell\n\nWellesley\n\nWake Forest\n\nBarnard\n\n\r\r  \nRejections:\r  \n\r  \nUChicago\r  \nJohns Hopkins\r  \nAmherst\r  \nWilliams\r  \nMount Holyoke\r  \nSmith\r  \nDavidson\r  \nNorthwestern\r  \nEmory\r  \nGeorgetown \r  \nDuke\r  \nBrown\r  \nDartmouth\r  \nPrinceton\r  \nUPenn\r  \nYale\r  \nPrinceton\r  \nColumbia\r  \nNYU\r  \n\r  \nAdditional Information:\r  \n\r  \nBeing homeschooled meant my applications weren't really standard (no APs, mostly), but I'd be happy to answer any questions!"

Freshman year English teacher: 10/10. While she later ended up switching schools she told me that she looked forward so much to teaching me in AP Lang that she considered me when deciding to switch. Obviously my favorite teacher. She was the person who convinced me to apply to NYU in the first place.\n2. Boston University Professor: 6/10. I doubt he remembered me at all after that program, but having a professor's name to attach to my recommendation was appreciated! My friends crocheted him mouse hats after our program, so hopefully he at least remembered that.\n3. Theater director: ??/10. I asked my theater director to write me a letter of recommendation after I realized I needed a letter of recommendation FAST. This was before we had a real chance to work together, so while she hadn't yet been subjected to my attitude, she also didn't have a chance to get to know me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Additional Information:*\n\nTwo things.\n\nFirst, I know I have to preemptively defend myself because I only applied to schools out of state and probably cooked myself. When I applied to colleges, I was so sick of the suburban enclave I'd grown up in that I just wanted an escape. And, since I graduated early, I didn't have the advice to *just apply dipshit*. I do regret not applying to UCs now that the reality of my financial situation has set in, however, life is chaotic and messy and I'm confident in myself that if I end up going to community college for two years I'll be able to make the most of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, my essays definitely carried my otherwise unimpressive profile. My CommonApp essay was ballsy, detailing how I've grown from my former years as a stereotypical Reddit atheist and learned to respect others' beliefs, finding a sort of higher meaning via contemporary art. When itemizing acceptances/waitlists/rejections below, I'll detail any essays of note that were particularly audacious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rejections:* none!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Waitlists (all applied RD):*\n\nBryn Mawr -> wrote my \"what social inequity would you choose to eliminate\" essay on wanting to eliminate pressure put onto marginalized people to use trauma to justify themselves, calling out colleges for expecting traumatic anecdotes.\n\nTulane -> called them slutty in my two sentence long \"why us?\" essay. Still no clue how I got waitlisted and not either accepted or rejected, but I hope an AO has my \"essay\" on their fridge somewhere.\n\nMacaulay Honors College -> not surprised, honestly. In my interview, I think the head of the Honors College could tell I was running from my family and home and therefore chose not to accept me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Acceptances (all applied RD):*\n\nPortland State University\n\nCUNY Hunter College\n\nCUNY flagship\n\nUMass Boston (15k annual scholarship)\n\nPace University (30k annual scholarship, though suspicious of this school lowkey)\n\nReed College -> wrote my \"what class would you teach at Reed\" essay about all the subjects I enjoy, and how they'd \"just have to wait until I'm admitted to see what I choose.\" Guess that worked?\n\nBoston University -> middest essays since this was one of the first I applied to. Only got into their \"College of General Studies\" for the first two years, so fuck them too, haha.\n\nNew York University -> wrote my essay on the Bushism \"you misunderestimated me,\" though took it away from the political implications. Honestly, I know I should be ecstatic. This is my dream school. I got accepted to their school of individualized majors, which would allow me to study both art history *and* neuroscience in a combined degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER. My family's financial situation is sticky since my mom really should get a divorce and her biggest concern is finances. I refuse to put her in a position where she has to pay for expensive private school tuition.\n\nEqually as much, I don't want her to have to spend 40k a year on a mid out-of-state school. Again, I know I will be able to thrive no matter where I go, so I'll probably end up in community college for two years. Hardly the end of the world, maybe baby bird can grow feathers before she's kicked out the nest.\n\nIf anyone has some magical advice to extort NYU for financial aid they otherwise wouldn't give, though, I'm more than all ears."

        "post": "UPDATE: ALSO GOT INTO STANFORD!!!\nFollowing the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1bq9u9o/9_rejections_8_waitlists_one_acceptance_and_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I just made, I've received a lot of requests to share my stats. Since I was on a similar situation last year, I'd rather share them now than make people wait. Thanks a lot once again for all the support and congrats I've received, it genuinely means a lot <3\n\nDisclaimer: I know that you might not believe it now, but always take a step back when you see one's stats. I may have gotten into Harvard, but I also got rejected from Yale, Cornell, Penn, NYU, JHU, Duke, Brown, Duke, and Amhrest. This goes to show that factors such as fit with the school are understated and shouldn't be overlooked.\n\n1. Demographics\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace/Ethnicity: White\n\nResidence: International Student (EU Citizen from Germany)\n\nHooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): N/A\n\nIntended Major: Applied as Mathematics pretty much everywhere. I remember vaguely indicating that I'd also be interested in double majoring in Economics given the research exposure I've had to it. But if indicating a double major wasn't possible, I simply went with Math.\n\n2. Academics\n\nGPA/Rank (or percentile): Taking the German Abitur with an average of 1.0 (highest possible is 1.0) with 1.0 in all subjects. Valedictorian of my school (size \u2248 1000). Public German School. Can't get on the details of the German Abitur because it would take forever, but in a nutchell, I took STEM and Econ at an advanced level and languages/humanities at a lower level.\n\n# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: N/A\n\n3. Standardized Testing\n\nSAT (took it once in May): 1590 (800 M, 790 EBRW)\n\n4. Honors\n\nTons of Math basically:\n\n* Performed in multiple national Math competitions that I listed (ranked in the top 20 for high schoolers)\n* Performed in EU/Europe level competition (and received a Gold Award in UKMT Challenge)\n* Gold Medal in EU level swimming competitions.\n* Reached the last stage of qualifiers to the IMO in Germany (went to an IMO bootcamp). Was 3 spots off qualifying to the IMO.\n\n1. ECs\n\n4 of my ECs specifically took a lot of my time:\n\na. National Maths team during high school. Competed in France, the UK, and other countries. Unfortunately covid made it tough at first.\n\nb. National Team in Debate (performed in Singapore and Eastern Europe) \n\nc. Competitive Football and swimming (EU-level competitions) - Mostly 10th grade and below though.\n\nd. Jazz (Self-learned guitar) and played in local bars in Munich on Saturday (got paid for it)\n\nThe rest:\n\n* Pioneer Academics Economic Research (I got funded by a German organization) with a Harvard Econ Professor (I think this played a huge role in me getting in) in Spring 2023 (Spring of 11th grade)\n* President of Student Government this year\n* Chief of Staff of the Newspaper at my school in 10th grade\n* random stuff, like MUNs, tutoring at my school, and cycling group every sunday with people that were much older than me lol\n\n1. Essays\n\nPersonal Statement:\n\nIn a nutchel, my essay explores the concept of feeling out of place at home, using Ikea furniture as a metaphor. Just as arranging furniture in a room can create a sense of harmony or discord, I found a similar connection through my affinity for mathematics. I likened the assembly of Ikea items to my immersion in Math.\n\nI reflected on how familial dynamics, akin to the wear and tear on Ikea furniture, can deteriorate over time. This deterioration mirrored the strain within my parents' relationship. Consequently, I sought solace outside my home, finding resonance in the structured environment of a math boot camp.\n\nI concluded my essay by explaining that my passion for Math served as a healing force amid my tumultuous upbringing. I emphasized that just as an \"ugly\" placement within a room, symbolizing my parents' troubled marriage, does not negate the value of a more \"attractive\" placement, representing my affinity for Math. Both can coexist within the same space, showcasing the complexity of human experiences.\n\nHarvard Supps:  \nIdentity question: Talked about the European Christian Culture I grew up with, and how it affected my sexual orientation exploration.\n\nIntellectual Experience: Talked about a very detailed math problem that fascinates me\n\nECs Experience: Spoke about the Math bootcamp weeks (those were the best weeks of my life so I had to).\n\nRoommate: Introduced myself, explained what Germany meant to me and how being raised there was important to my identity, apologized in advance for the Jazz I'll play and explained that I am always happy to make compromises with them, and told them they will hear me talk about probability concepts because I binge watch probability videos.\n\n7. Others \\[Edit\\]\n\nLanguages: Fluent German, Dutch, and English\n\nInterviews: 2 AO interviews with Harvard (very early on, like early January), I got a Columbia Conversation call that was meant for low-income and first-gen students, Dartmouth Alumni Interview, Princeton Alumni Interview, Stanford Alumni Interview.\n\nFinancial Status: Needing high aid/ close to full ride (could have paid a max of 8-10k USD and that's my parents hustling).\n\nI hope this helps! I genuinely gave out as much as I could.\n\nAs for the results:  \nAccepted: Harvard ;-), Stanford\n\nWaitlists: MIT Chicago Middlebury Northeastern Dartmouth Columbia Princeton Williams (will drop all except MIT and Princeton)\n\nRejections: Yale Cornell Brown Penn NYU JHU Northwestern Duke Amhrest\n\nEDIT: I GOT INTO STANFORD!!!!!!!!!!!"

I spent the vast majority of my time in high school studying philosophy, religion, and art. My parents are not supportive of this and I've done it entirely in secret, so I have no tangible accomplishments. This led me to take what I saw as a high risk high reward approach and focus all of my essays on my philosophy as I have nothing else going for me. I saw this as my \"spike\".\n\nA significant amount of my time in high school was spent on one particular philosophical theory I created. I won't give details because it's basically what I intend to spend the rest of my life on (along with filmmaking), and I intend to publish it within the next few years. I've spent a very long time on vetting the argument and I believe it to be logically sound. When I reached the point where I believed I had a complete, logically valid argument sometime in the summer between junior and senior years, I decided to make this the focus of my commonapp essay. For context, I fully believe this theory will change the world if it's true, so this was a risk worth taking for me. My commonapp didn't mention a word about myself. It was just a succinct description of this theory. All supplementals were about various aspects of my philosophy and beliefs and how they play out in my life.\n\nI've always been told I'm a fantastic writer which also gave me the confidence to try and pull this off. I spent an obscene amount of time on my essays for all of the schools and film portfolios for NYU and USC. I thought these essays were some of the best written things I've ever done, and I thought some of the artistic material included in my portfolios was some of my best work.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):**\n\n**Acceptances (RD):**\n\nFordham University\n\n**Rejections (RD):**\n\nHarvard University\n\nUniversity of Southern California (SCA, Film and TV Production)\n\nNew York University (Tisch, Film and TV Production)\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome more context: I didn't even want to go to college until junior year. I wanted to go immediately into independent filmmaking and/or writing about aforementioned philosophy. I began to doubt the feasibility of this plan junior year and decided to apply for college. The only schools I really had any interest in attending were USC, NYU, or Harvard (the first two for their film programs, and the last because of its film program combined with the research opportunities I thought might be useful to publish my theory).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately, it didn't work out for me. At the tail end of junior year after deciding to go for college, I watched countless hours of college application advice and read every single article I could find. After consuming such a massive amount of college content, I decided that my application was nowhere near competitive enough to get in to the schools I wanted and I had to go big and fully explain the thing I had spent all of my time on. At the end of the day, I can never really know what would've happened if I took a traditional approach, but I'm pretty confident it wouldn't have gone any better. I also wouldn't be able to sleep at night.\n\nI spent a long time trying to find a post, article, or any advice online from someone in a situation similar to mine and could never find any. So, for anyone who has some bonkers idea (whether it's a philosophical theory or something else) and is wondering if it's a golden ticket to a top school: probably not. I've spent the past 4 years of my life on it and even managed to convince a few friends, completely changing their worldview. I don't think the theory is the problem and, while my writing certainly wasn't perfect, I think I got it across clearly. I saw it as my only chance of getting in and I still think that's probably true. It just didn't work out, and it's pretty disappointing for me, but maybe someone else can learn from this."

It\u2019s just such a massive advantage to apply ED but I was worried about how much it would cost and having to back out if it ended up being too much money. My top 3 were Dartmouth, middlebury, and williams and went 0 for 3. I really like Emory and Boston college but Arkansas gave me a full ride plus I have a friend going there. Any advice is welcome, I\u2019m happy with my results. I wasn\u2019t expecting to get into any particular school bc there\u2019s so much randomness involved. The one I\u2019m most upset about is Dartmouth bc I legitimately spent weeks on my essays working for hours each day and i loved the school so so damn much. At the end of the day it is what it is, idrc. I\u2019m happy with Emory plus they gave me the option to go to the Oxford campus which is a relief. Im glad it\u2019s over, the whole process depressed me hella waiting for answers and everything. But woo pig ig? Leaning towards Arkansas what yall think tho?\n\n\n"

I don\u2019t want to rate them because I haven\u2019t read them, but when we get report cards, at my school, they come with really long personalized comments and I picked my recommenders based on what they said in those comments. My main humanities recommender I\u2019ve had for three classes was pretty much the reason I applied early to Princeton (he also went there as a comp lit major) and we talk about books a lot, I cannot imagine he said anything bad. My main STEM recommender was my junior bio teacher, I think she liked me, and we also talked a lot about books. I went to her office hours a lot (and I still don\u2019t understand the electron transport chain!), so at the very least, I think she wrote that I was dedicated. I got an additional letter of rec from my poetry teacher who is also my Lit Mag advisor and submitted it to all the schools I applied to with a poetry portfolio, he\u2019s the teacher I knew the longest at my school and we\u2019re close (?). Again, this is all speculative. My friend since I was two wrote my Dartmouth Peer rec, I read it and cried, but I think that might just be because we're really close.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI had interviews with all the schools that offer them with the exception of Yale. None of them were super notable, just generally good pleasant conversations. TBH, I cannot recall a lot because my mind just totally blacks out during these interviews. The one memorable one was my Harvard one, she was super chill and we had a good convo and at the end, she was like \u201cI know you\u2019ll end up somewhere good.\u201d Melody if you\u2019re reading this ilysm.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI really liked my personal statement, it\u2019s definitely a little corny, but it exemplifies the things I found valuable and showed some good personal qualities. Most of the people who read it (my counselor, friends, parents, etc\u2026) all said that it was really me, so I'll take it. When I got letters from admissions offices about my acceptance, they often referenced my essay. Speculatively, I think my supplements were also good. I spent a lot of time on them and (I think) did a good job of connecting all of them back to myself and my story/major. I really tried to emphasize the writing and literature spike that I had. I think my Yale/UChicago supplements were the best because they had the most cohesive story/narrative to them (but really who's to say!).  I never turned in anything that I didn\u2019t think was good tho. Also, my mom had cancer, I really milked that one in a lot of essays.\n\n**Decisions**\n\nAmherst RD (European Studies & Philosophy) >!rejected!<\n\nSUNY Binghamton EA (Comp Lit) >!accepted!<\n\nBrown RD (Comp Lit & Linguistics) >!waitlisted-->ACCEPTED!!!!!<\n\nDartmouth RD (Comp Lit & Linguistics) >!waitlisted!<\n\nGeorgetown RD (Comp Lit & Linguistics) >!waitlisted!<\n\nHarvard RD (Comp Lit & Linguistics) >!waitlisted!<\n\nHaverford RD (Comp Lit & Linguistics) >!accepted!<\n\nKenyon RD (Modern Languages & Literatures) >!accepted w/ 30k/yr!<\n\nMt.

At the end I highlighted how all my craftsmaking hobbies have prepared me to enter my career path. Kinda cliche and hyper-specific.\n\nSyracuse (3/10): I hadn't even finished my main common app essay when the deadline arrived and I was screwed. Wrote the essay in one night about a stargazing trip to the Arches National Park. \n\nSupplements (7/10): Some of them were mid cause I was doing them in a rush (CU Boulder, Virginia Tech). But the rest were so good I love reading them. I talked about how my Sci-Fi movie obsession along with helping my dad fix his semi truck got me into engineering.

I just feel heavily underqualified ngl. I've always heard UW Madison is somewhat selective for engineering and I'm genuinely very shocked I got in. But I am also eternally grateful and I'll most likely committ there!! \n\nWaiting on:\n\n* Purdue (RD) - another reach! not expecting to get in but I'm happy already!"

I'm most likely gonna end up at my state school, which isn't too bad by any means, but I was really hoping for better results, at least with Northwestern. As far as ECs and essays go, I really didn't show any experiences that separated or defined me. I guess the main takeaway is to not procrastinate, and apply to safeties."

Fair warning to those who live in states with amazing flagships (TX, CA, FL, NC, GA, MI, etc), DO NOT get attached to your flagship. I made the mistake of falling in love with UT, and I genuinely started planning out my freshman year because I was so confident I would get in. Secondly, make sure to apply to targets. I honestly don't know where I'd commit if I didn't apply to Purdue, UW Madison, and UMD. One last thing: be happy for your friends when they get into schools. I know it sucks seeing someone get what you want, but it's easier for you to be happy for them."

Helped me calm my nerves before I started b/c I lowkey forgot I signed up for one during my visit but we ended up having a conversation that lasted towards an hour. Got to talk about my passions and pride with heritage and went on tangents about coffee and the history of Ethiopia. Sent me a nice letter in the mail afterwards about it too.\n\n**Princeton** 8/10: my interviewer was a retired lawyer so even tho i had interests in stem, we went on tangents about public policy, personal experiences with politics and making/connecting with old friends. spoke for 45 min and it naturally felt like 2 friends having a convo. said i had great confidence and good answers! also gave me a lot of suggestions about what to do/explore if i do end up going.\n\n**Dartmouth**: 9/10: interview lasted about an hour and my interviewer was a psych prof at the uni i did research at and was class of 64 from dartmouth. he was surprisingly impressed by my resume and the amount of activities i did as he went through each one on the copy i gave him. talked a lot about my research and the program i started . also got to talk a lot about my heritage and growing up FGLI for part of the interview and he seemed very interested in. asked if ed'd there but hoped i would get in. suggested id be a really good fit given i was interested in environmental studies and looking for tight-knit community.\n\n**Cornell**: 6/10: nothing too special and significant. my interviewer was on call in his car and basically said that the interview was just supposed to be informational. just explained to me why i should come to cornell and asked if i have any questions about the campus/programs\n\n**Essays**:Common App: 9/10 I LOVE MY ESSAY SO MUCH and a lot of people liked it too. talked about niche hobby i had about crushing rocks when i was like 6. connected it to my passions for environmental sci. as well as a cool metaphor for getting closer with my culture.\n\nSupps; 7-8/10: Reused a lot since I applied to 28 schools.

Because of this program and moving schools after being virtual for COVID, I had credit transferring and scheduling issues which limited my # of APs I could take pretty much all 4 years. Overall, I wanted to still challenge myself over the years so my rigor increased with honors and DE classes while still maintaining my GPA. I also did this b/c I though I was gonna go to my state school anyway\ud83d\udc80. I made sure to explain this in my add. info and had my counselor talk about it in LOR.-I mentioned in my add. info that I'm taking Coursera courses in Calc 1 and Gen chem in my free time since I could not fit them in my schedule. Don't know if that's helpful tho.\n\n**Final Notes**:\n\nI am not expecting much being that I am test-op with no ap scores. That pretty much screwed me from the start. However, I am really really content with my options. I know some of you guys had expressed hope in getting into one or some ivys in some of my previous posts but I lowkey have no hope. Given the competitiveness of admissions nowadays, I am just trying to put positive vibes out there but I feel like I am about to be so cooked tomorrow \ud83d\ude2d."

One thing to note is that for NEU I was originally deferred EA and switched into the ED2 pool afterward, and got into the NUIN program, not my first choice of Boston, so it's not binding. Definitely disappointed with the UCs but I knew what was coming because of test blind admissions."

I did amazing in her class, but she did not like me very much because I was kind of a loud asshole in the back and always showed up high to class (she could tell I think) and didn\u2019t do any of the homework, since it didn\u2019t count for a grade. \n \nLetter 2:\nJunior yr English teacher\n\nI had a much better relationship with this teacher than my calc teacher but we only had 1 semester together and it was an English class that I did not do very well in. \n\n**Essays**\n\nI spent a long time on my essay but I didn\u2019t fully like how it came out. My school has lots of college counselors and writing tutors that helped me. I wrote about my experience with learning how to solve a Rubik\u2019s cube and how that process mirrors engineering thinking and also how I used that to pass my driving test. The idea was pretty cohesive and people said they loved the concept but I think the quality of writing itself was mid \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n- Loyola Marymount Universiry (mechanical engineering) EA\n- Drexel University (Mechanical Engineering) EA\n- Colorado School Of Mines (Mechanical Engineering) EA\n- UC Santa Barbara (didn\u2019t get ME, got my 2nd choice pre-mathematics) RD\n- Purdue University (First Year Engineering) Deferred EA -> Accepted RD\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n- Northeastern University (Deferred EA -> Waitlist)\n- University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (Deferred EA -> Waitlist)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n- Georgia Tech EA\n- UC Irvine RD\n- UC Los Angeles RD\n- UC San Diego RD\n\nStill waiting on Columbia and UC Berkeley, but I mean\u2026 not happening I think\n\n**Additional Information:**\nSpecifically for Purdue, I submitted a letter of continued interest after being deferred from EA. I sent my senior yr 1st semester transcript  along with that, which comes with written feedback from every teacher. My physics teacher specifically clutched up and wrote some crazy glazing so I thought I had to include it in my letter of continued interest, as her and I have developed a great relationship in her physics 2 class this year. Other teachers did have feedback on my report card but hers was by far the most beneficial for my application, as it\u2019s a physics class. Here\u2019s her feedback that I sent to Purdue:\n\nAdditional remarks:\n[Name], your success this semester was outstanding. I am so impressed by how logically and deeply you think about physics, in particular the way you gleefully model and incorporate mathematics into your problem solving. It is genuinely a pleasure to read your derivations and problem sets, and I think you should consider writing technical texts professionally. Next term, please give a concerted effort to minimizing side conversation during class, and keep up the great work.\n\nI feel like this is important to note because Purdue was the only school I sent my report card to and they were also my only deferral/RD that I got into."

COA for Purdue would only be slightly higher than Boulder. On another note, is it possible to leverage my Purdue FYE acceptance and somehow get Boulder to put me in AeroEng instead of Undecided? That might be a stupid question, sorry.\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n**Edit:** about three weeks later, I got into Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder.

Had PS checked with A LOT of people, but it was good from the get-go. Several people have said it has my authentic voice, and I truly love it. It's about my childhood speech impediment (cliche, I know) with a little twist. Has heavy allusions to my interests in Classics and Social Justice.\n\n  \n**\\*\\*Misc. Notes\\*\\***  \nJunior year I was also accepted to:  \n\\* TASS  \n\\* Stanford Summer Humanities Institute  \nAnd my counselor said they would briefly mention my tass acceptance in my rec!\n\n  \n**Interviews:**\n\n  \n**Tufts 0/10**  \nWhole interview was just\u2026 odd. They joined almost 40 minutes late bc they were painting a wall. While they seemed nice, they also came off as a bit socially inept(?). Semi-Grilled me on the difference between Spoken Word and just reading off written poetry(???) when I mentioned I wanted to get into Spoken Word at Tufts. When I send thank you letters to alumni, I also make an effort to mention a minor detail we talked about in our convo. I sent a small joke about one of their extracurricular activities they mentioned, to which they replied, \u201cOh no, that was only an example of what you could do at Tufts!\u201d \u2026 I know\u2026 that(?) Really wack.\n\n  \n**Oberlin 9.8/10**  \nContinuously exclaimed \u201cwow\u201d about my extracurricular involvement. And it was a pleasant & light conversation!\n\n**Dartmouth 7/10**\nAlmost 1 hour, but not in a good way \ud83d\ude15  They mainly gave me a mini verbal tour of Dartmouth (discussing academics, clubs, and environment). BUT he mentioned that having an interview w them (in my area, at least) meant I made it through the first round of cuts! Also bonded slightly about having a childhood speech impediment :)\n  \n**Princeton 9/10**  \nScared bc they were a Physics major, but we really clicked! Great conversation and noted that I would be a great fit with Princeton\u2019s research environment. And we had a long discussion on the nuances of Classics and how the field is evolving \ud83d\ude42  \n\n\n**Harvard 9.5/10**  \nReally clicked. Talked about how my Fellowship over the summer made me realize that Harvard is one of the best fits for me Classics Dpt.-wise. Put me in contact with an alumni following our conversation too!  \n\n\n**Georgetown 9.5/10**  \nGreat! In a crowded starbucks. I talked about my Classics research interests and they continually said that I should keep note of everything I\u2019m interested in to prepare for a PhD! The person sitting next to us also chimed in that they would read a dissertation on my interest \u2620\ufe0fThey said that Georgetown was a great fit for my service interests, and that with my drive, I would do well anywhere.  \n\n\n**UPenn\u2013 N/A/10**  \nCould never find a right time for an interview. Then, they stopped responding to my messages :(  \n\n\n**Swarthmore 7/10**  \nConducted during Fly-In. Not memorable to me, but seemingly good impression.  \n\n\n**Holy Cross 6.8/10**  \nAlso during Fly-in, w/ regional admissions officer. Seemed a bit bored by my Classics stuff, but lit up when I mentioned writing. Said that I should email a copy of my writing portfolio to them, then misspelled my name in the reply email \ud83d\ude41  \n\n\n**Holy Cross Classics 9.8/10**\n\nGreat! I love HC's Classics Department. Bumped into Classics faculty interviewer during Fly-In, and made an instant connection.  \n\n\n**Duke 9/10**  \nGreat! Scared because the email came 2 or so days before the interview deadline. But it went great! Again, they were interested in my Classics research interests, and said Duke was a great fit for people interested in research.\n\n  \n**Colleges + Decisions So Far:**\n\n  \n**Acceptances**  \nEA:  \n\\- Villanova \\*rejected from Presidential Scholarship  \n\\- 2 of my State Schools (+ 2 full-tuition Scholarships)  \n\\- Fordham  \nRD:  \n\\- WashU (\\*Twin got in ED)  \n\\- Holy Cross (+ Merit Scholarship + Full-tuition Classics Scholarship Awardee, but ended up turning it down)  \n\\- Connecticut College  \n\\- St Andrews     \n\\- Trinity College  \n\\- WILLIAMS (what?! after getting rejected from their fly-in. + college-funded trip to admitted students day!)   \n\\- Swarthmore (+college-funded trip to Swatlight/Swatstruck!)   \n\\- Oberlin      \n\\- Georgetown (OMG!?!)   \n\\- UC Berkeley (ayo??)        \n\\- Duke (omg \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d)       \n\\- Dartmouth (definitely was not the ivy I was expecting \ud83d\udc80) AND ATTENDING \u203c\ufe0f\ud83e\udd2d\n\\- Howard\n\n\n**Waitlists**   \n\\- Skidmore      \n\\- Syracuse (waitlisted to Discovery Program, rejected from main campus???)                    \n\\- Tufts  \n\\- Northwestern       \n\\- Vanderbilt     \n\\- UPenn!!\n\n  \n**Rejections**  \n\\- Yale (REA)  \n\\- UCLA  \n\\- Hopkins (this one hurt \ud83e\udd72)        \n\\- Barnard    \n\\- Columbia  \n\\- Harvard  (hurtttt \ud83d\ude2d)\n\\- Brown   \n\\- Stanford  \n\\- Princeton  \n  \n**Waiting On\u2026:**  \n\n  \n(say my college list 10 times fast x-|)\n\n  \nUhhh yeah I think that's it.

I initially wasn't thinking of submitting so many apps, but I got a Common App fee waiver and felt like it would've been a shame if I didn't take full advantage of it so...\n* As a junior, I was worried about college apps bc I didn't think there was anything super unique about me or my story compared to all of the other students I saw on social media and stuff, but over time I realized that as long as I showcased my best self inside and outside of class, there would be at least one school interested in having me\n\nAlso, if any current juniors/folks working on UC apps need PIQ examples, I'm happy to send you mine with personal info removed. I'm in no way qualified to give official advice, but I found that I really benefitted from reading other people's essays and figuring out what works and what to avoid. Of course, write in your own voice about your own experiences and passions, but it's nice to have a model to learn dos and don'ts from."

Then, University of Washington was my favorite. Got waitlisted, and now, looking at how much it will cost, it's not looking to appealing. I didn't get into any state schools either (UGA and GATech), so that makes costs not so appealing in general (even though they don't matter that much for my family).  \n\n\nCU Boulder and Virginia Tech are both OOS state schools, and overall are likely too expensive for the education I'd receive as an Arts & Sciences person. So, I think I'm probably going to Sewanee. It was never my first choice as a school, but I've come to like it more and more as I've done research (gaslighting myself? maybe. idk.). I'm overall quite dissatisfied with how college has turned out for me,, but it is what it is. I can always transfer if I don't like Sewanee. Sewanee is also cheaper than the state schools despite being private, so that's nice.  \n\n\nI'm still entirely surprised I didn't get into UGA as an in-state person though. As far as I can tell, UGA looked more at GPA and class rank than they led on, as, despite me and a close friend having similar GPAs but Higher test scores than those that got in, and even having better ECs, we still got straight rejected."

I always did all my homework last minute, and would do a last minute lock in every year to get my grades to A's. Though I had really shit 9th grade grades (3 B's), and a B in a math course every year.\n\nMy biggest regret was probably my SAT score, I only took the SAT once due to procrastination, and so I could have easily gotten a 1400+ that would have probably helped me if I had chosen to apply to more ivies. Would have also probably gotten into Purdue. I kind of expected these results to be honest, Purdue still is my #1 school, and I hope I can go there. Else it will probably be UCSD as my 2nd choice. "

What I can say is I got to meet some cool people from them, and they had an okay user base. I\u2019m not a very good programmer, I only know one programming language (which i\u2019m still learning), but I love these projects dearly.\n2. Graphic Design: I did this for my personal project and for online friends who had their own coding projects. This is not something i\u2019m very good at either, I definitely don\u2019t know some core fundamentals, but I can make some professional marketing material.\n3. E-Commerce Site: Something I did for someone close to me. They wanted it to be made as cheap as possible (since they were moving away from an online marketplace to avoid fees), and I was able to deliver. Though honestly my work here was just okay.\n4.

How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?\u201d*\n- I talked about my growth mindset.

How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?\u201d*\n- Let\u2019s not talk about this one.

I am an Asian interested in CS. I wasn\u2019t offered the most challenging APs available at my school, I didn\u2019t have any awards, or any stand-out extracurriculars. I didn\u2019t have a lot of leadership opportunities, nor had I participated in any volunteer opportunities. I hadn\u2019t had any friends my first 2 years at school, nor had I really kept up with the opportunities my school provided, so what I mainly had to show for myself was what I did out of interest.\n\nSo getting accepted into some excellent universities really shocked me. Especially with the UCs since they review applications holistically. I don\u2019t know what those UCs saw in me, but maybe I\u2019m clouded by how I see myself and my achievements.\n\n\n**[TIP]:**\n\nIf you are a California Resident, do not, and I mean **DO NOT** sleep on the CSUs. A couple of people I know have only applied to the UCs and while they definitely got into one, they were taking an unnecessary risk.\n\nMany of the UCs are **some of the most applied-to colleges in the nation**. Even if your stats give you a good chance of getting into one, it\u2019s not a guarantee that you will get into one.\n\nIf you would rather attend a CSU instead of being a CC to UC Transfer, I would HIGHLY recommend you apply to the CSUs, especially if you have a fee waiver. They\u2019re great colleges on their own right, are usually less costly than a UC, and are primarily focused on teaching undergraduate students which might suit you better over a UC (And which also appears to be why they rank lower on national rankings).\n\nApplying to 4 CSUs takes only about an hour (this does not include EOP), and is totally worth it if you still want to attend a university after High School."

Second I would advise you to graduate a semester early .if its an option and take the time to do whatever you want. Its my only regret in high school and I could be on vacation instead of being in school rn.\n\nSome application advice. I contacted a guy at UPenn that reads and scores applications that greatly improved my understanding of admissions. He told me that they have to answer only two questions for every applicant: What kind of Student are they? and What kind of alumni will they be? And admissions committee decisions basically depend on that second Question. Picking the right prompt is **extremely** important, for example northwestern has a prompt that asks something like what parts of chicago appeals to you? There's just no point in writing prompts like these and committee isn't going to be able to answer the 2 questions.\n\nThere's more so PM me if y'all got any questions.\n\n\n\n"

Currently planning a recycling campaign but that's too recent for applications\n\n\\#6 Involvement with Climate Interest Group: 3hrs/week, organizing youth, educating others about climate policy & action, participation in organized lobbying (mostly this is just sending emails & calling Congress whenever a climate bill is on the floor lol)\n\n\\#7 Model UN: 3hrs/week, I'm not officially in leadership here but I help out with organizing meetings sometimes & have been to a couple conferences (just joined this year so not super crazy with involvement)\n\n\\#8 Robotics (FRC): 15hrs/week, team photographer, set up infrastructure for a few fundraisers, raised like \\~$6000 for the team, attended/helped put on quite a few outreach events including field trips & talking to local officials, helping with county grant application... pretty involved in this but I'm not a STEM enjoyer typically so the most I've done on that side of things is like a little bit of CAD\n\n\\#9 Advanced Choir: 8hrs/week, vice president of activities, performances at graduation & sports games, 4x a year formalized performances, performed at festivals, etc. high ranking from the state choir people.\n\n\\#10 Worship Bassist: 4hrs/week, perform in front of a decently sized congregation about 2x a month, obviously i practice & learn theory and stuff but I'm not insanely good. i just do it for fun mostly!\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nAP Scholar (lol)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCounselor: 7/10 probably, I like her & stop by her office frequently but I don't think she was expecting me to shoot for a 4-year university since I told her my sophomore year that I thought I was going to go to cc first. Made a comment that she always saw me reading around campus!\n\nAP Human Geography Teacher: 10/10 I LOVED THIS MAN SO MUCH. only had him for a year but he saw a lot of the really good sides of me academically! I had so much fun in that class, was definitely one of his best students, sparked my interest in urban planning & public policy.\n\nAP English Language: ??/10 i literally do not know. she liked me but i sort of goofed off in her class and never wrote anything super phenomenal (besides one or two essays)\n\nYouth Group Leader: ???/10 Not a teacher but hopefully spoke to the more leadership & personal sides of me! She's been a really important mentor in my life in more ways than just spiritual so I think that she definitely had good things to say but not sure about her capabilities as a writer as humanities is not her field.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nBowdoin 8/10: Guy was super nice and had graduated from the program I applied for! We just ended up talking about public policy for most of the time lol, I think he seemed impressed with some of my community involvement despite it not being anything super crazy. I asked a lot of questions about his life. Pretty solid experience, I feel I could have been slightly less professional though!\n\nLafayette 7/10: Decent, me & my interviewer were both very professional but dipped into some personal stuff like my father's death & family situation. He recommended me to a specific major which I thought was cool, and I think he was impressed with the variety of things I spend my time on and my general curiosity. I had this after a weekend of being very busy so I was pretty tired unfortunately.\n\nGrinnell 2/10: So bad. I showed up late because of a miscommunication regarding the time so I was very flustered. I don't think she was impressed at all with my courseload/interests and when we were talking about Grinnell as an institution the vibes were just very odd and I slipped up with a lot of the stuff I said.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App essay: my magnum opus probably. wrote about my hometown, the importance of good urban planning, community, sustainable development, some cool ecology stuff, and tied it all into my personal building of political will in order to find hope in the world. it was all over the place but tbh i'm super proud of it and it definitely reflects my hopes for my future & what i find important both academically and personally.\n\nPIQs:\n\n1st was about community gardening as a kid and how i began to find beauty in the world around me! Also critiquing the global food & trade system that we have today. ecological cycles & life and death! i am pretty proud of this one. my friends who read my application said this was my strongest.\n\n2nd was basically just my common app essay (urban planning & political will) but shorter, talked about community collaboration & the importance of compromise in modern politics\n\n3rd was about my journey with grief and how my interactions with others have helped widen my worldview. this one was very personal obviously.\n\n4th was the wildcard. I thought it was really funny, it was essentially making fun of academia as an end but appreciating it as a means to knowledge. i took sort of an \"if i was a professor...\" format. genuinely don't know how to explain this. let me know if you're interested in reading it though because i thought i conveyed my point very concisely!\n\nsupps:\n\ntulane: good, i think this is to credit for my waitlist there tbh.\n\nlafayette: since I've been around engineers so much i spoke about my admiration of their interdisciplinary programs & mentioned a few projects (research and otherwise) that id like to start\n\nbowdoin: california water politics & the value of sitting with nature to recognize your role in the world (are you noticing a theme yet lol)  this was the poem one so i was very prosey with it. i'm also expecting literally zero from bowdoin and i knew that going into it so i just had fun with this more than anything!\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nUCD, UCSC, Cal State Fullerton, San Diego State, Oregon State, Whitman\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\nGrinnell, Kenyon, Tulane, Denison, U Vermont\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nUCSD, Middlebury, Bates\n\n*Waiting:*\n\nUCSB, Cal Poly SLO, Bowdoin, Lafayette\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\ni thought i'd put a post up here because i think my activities have been relatively normal for a high schooler (compared to most people who post here... geez you guys are crazy...) and i genuinely wasn't even thinking about applying for colleges up until the summer of last year! just goes to show you can get into some pretty solid schools without being insane... enjoy the journey. i haven't done most things i should have for college, and sure I haven't gotten in anywhere crazy competitive, but that's okay.\n\n obviously, my family has a lot to do with this- the academic pressure has been nonexistent and all of this stuff has just been because i wanted to so take my application/results with a grain of salt. most of the people i'm surrounded with are going to community college first and tbh that was the expectation for me so i'm just surprised i pulled a UC Davis acceptance out of somewhere. i applied to basically everywhere else just for fun!\n\nmy essays were my strong suit and i credit my waitlists from super competitive schools on them mostly. my transcript is mid and i struggle with math a lot and you can make judgements about my extracurriculars as you wish.\n\n(also bear in mind i need basically full aid so that definitely factors into the decisions from the LACs)\n\nanyways! i hope this was a little bit encouraging! thank you for reading!!! predict my results for the last few? also help where should I go?"

This was because she absolutely hated my guts and thought I was talking back to her just for voicing my opinion about something that she had written wrong. She ended up getting fired after 1 year in the school. The rest of my English grades look good with a A and A in English language and literature respectively in IGCSE and 7s for my IB predicted grades (upward trend?)\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*\n\n1. *#1* Primary author of research paper alongside professors from university of Helsinki, paper was about heart transplants (dm for details).

Did bunch of hands on stuff. \n4. \\#4 Math and Science tutor for 3 years. Tutored 7 children with all of them having an increase in grades. Usually from terrible to decent \n5. \\#5 . Treasurer of school MUN.

Was my chemistry teacher in grade 10 and 11. Super nice guy who was very enthusiastic about chemistry. Personally, I thought I was his favourite student due to being very inquisitive about the subject and also scrutinising certain concepts that were taught, which he appreciated a lot. Not a 10/10 just because idk what he actually wrote \n\nEconomics teacher: 9/10 someone who\u2019s known me for 4 years teaching me economics from grade 9 to 12. Super nice guy. Again probably favourite student since I\u2019ve been with him for a long time and he appreciates the effort I put in during class. 9/10 because seemed slightly superficial \n\nHead of School: 8/10. Pretty cool to get a letter from the HOS but he didn\u2019t really know me much personally other than the good grades and some things I had done at school. So the letter was weighty but didn\u2019t seem personal. Kind of just a paraphrasing of my resume but what did I expect\n\n**Interviews**\n\nDuke (originally ED but switched to RD): okay interview. Coincidentally she was a cardiologist at a big local hospital so we talked a lot about my paper. But she didn\u2019t seem super interested in doing the interview. But also it did go on for like an hour with her asking me to make another zoom link so we could continue talking \n\nPrinceton: Chill short interview. Guy was nice. Talked about my extracurriculars as a whole \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m a very quiet person when it comes to new people so my baseline for a \u201cgood\u201d interview would be much lower than other people \n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nPersonally thought this was one of the strongest parts of my application. Wrote an essay about my meticulous sleep routine and how sleep is something that made me interested in research while weaving in the extracurriculars that I do. Supplements were nothing crazy other than my long ones for UTA and UW-M that were about how me and oats (yes the grain) are alike \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances: \nU of Oregon (18.5k merit + honors)\nOhio state (honors)\nCU - Boulder (6.25k merit)\nUConn storrs: 18.5k merit \nUF (6k merit)\nUMass Amherst (16.5k + study abroad)\nUW Seattle (4.3k merit)\nUMN TC (10k national scholarship)\nPurdue \n\n\n*Waitlists:* \nNone\n\n*Rejections:*\nUT-A (fucked me up)\nUNC chapel hill\nUVA\n\n*Waiting on*\nDartmouth \nDuke \nEmory \nPrinceton \nUW-Madison"

Because of both of their depression I have to do much more chores, cleaning, and etc so the house isn\u2019t totally disgusting (which is hard because they really don\u2019t help out at all) as well as help grocery shop, run errands, and etc.\n \n\nPCT (Completed course in 11th)\n\nCertified Patient Care Technician, completed about 50 clinical hours though the program and of course passed the test, leading me to being certified. \n\nAwards:\n\n3rd Place Literary \n\n1 Sliver Key, 2 Honorable Mention\n\nHOBY Scholar (selected out of entire sophomore class to attend state leadership conference for free)\n\n3rd Place Prize National Latin Exam\n\nNational Recognition Rural/Small Town\n\nEssays: I honestly believe my main essay was TRASH (especially the one I used UGA/GA Tech EA but my supplementals were good.

I still applied for aid though \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 (the exchange rate is shit over here)\n\nType of School: Went to a private catholic school, going to a private school in my country is very, very normal. (the public schools in my country are not it)\n\nHooks: None.\n\nIntended Major(s): Biomedical engineering /Bioengineering\n\n**Academics**\n\nGPA (UW/W): from all the websites I used, 3.8 (approximately)\n\nRank (or percentile): 2/86\n\nHonors/AP/dual enrollment: N/A\n\nSenior Year Course Load: I did 15 subjects in 9th and 11 from 10th to 11th. For my country's national exams, you can only write 9 subjects, so i took 9 in 12th grade\n\nStandardized Testing\n\nSAT: I was honestly proud of my SAT score, especially since I taught myself and took the exams when I was like 15?\n\nattempt 1 May 2022- 1340 \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80(640R 700M)\n\nattempt 2 August 2022- 1430\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80(670R 760M), did not submit to Cornell and Penn\n\nthinking about it, I should have retaken it, but to be quite frank, I didn't want to put myself through all of that again. Could have gotten a better score\n\nNational Exams: 6As 3Bs\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\nCreated an outreach program to tackle the problem young girls in the rural area of my country faced from inadequate education on the female reproductive system and their inability to cater for themselves during their menstrual cycle. This was my solution to the poor medical system in my country\n\nInternship at a clinic for 90 hours (gap year)\n\nVolunteered at a special education school for 60 hours, my sister has Down\u2019s syndrome so it was quite significant to me\n\nHave a blog where I talk about societal issues and my experiences, had it for two years\n\nSchool leadership- Dorm head- Was in charge of 100+ students in my dorm\n\nVarsity soccer and handball goalkeeper (only put soccer on common app, handball on my resume) 3 years\n\nSchool band member\n\nMember of the student council in 9th grade, spoke on behalf of my class\n\nTutor-  did this throughout school in different subjects\n\nFinancial secretary of my school\u2019s media club, for 2 years (till this day I am so angry I never got president )\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nMost of my awards were school-based so I put all of those on my resume.\n\nmy common app ones:\n\n1st in zonal/regional science competition\n\n5th in Bio Olympiad (first stage, state level)\n\nwe do end-of-the-year awards, (like class position, academic-based) so I put all those from 9th-12th grade.\n\n4 and 5 - subject awards\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nI don't know how you guys can assign numbers to this but mine were okay, I had the chance to read one of mine and it was standard, not excellent, but fair.\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy first Common App essay was about how winning a soccer match made me feel liberated from the \"smart girl is only good at academics stereotype\". Really liked it then, but wasn't spectacular, you'll see based on the results.\n\nThe second common app essay wasn't spectacular to me, but I had some friends who studied in the US and worked in the admissions department give me reviews. I was still told it wasn't that great by one of them, but what else am I supposed to do. I honestly don't know why I am supposed to have a breathtaking experience to write about when I am still trying to figure out my life.\n\nAnyways I wrote about my experience with having a huge head/forehead and how we were made to shave our heads in my school (a pretty normal experience in my country, apparently) made that insecurity prominent. Had an opportunity to do a hairstyle to cover my insecurity, but the stylist messed up (like I have a tiny scar on my hairline because of it), how that experience helped me overcome beauty standards and learn how to speak up when I am uncomfortable. Spoke about how I also shared my experience and didn't let people's opinions affect me.\n\n**BACKGROUND STORY**\n\nBefore I begin though, I had an admissions adviser for my first application round. I honestly think she didn't do much for me. She made me cry multiple times (to be fair I do already cry a lot). She helped me fill out my CSS profile and there were a lot of exaggerations there, but I guess she knows the best.\n\nMy mum told me I was taking a GAP year (she did not ask me what I wanted) to prepare to come to \u201cAMERICA\ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd85\u201d cause she believed I was not ready, but to her I was ready to go to boarding school at 11, however. Anyways it wasn\u2019t that bad, was able to do more ECs related to my major, but I still was/am moderately depressed most of the time.\n\nI haven't gotten all my decisions yet but whatever, wherever I end up, I know I will be happier than I am right now. I want to get into one reach, but if that\u2019s not what is in store for me, I am still very okay with that.\n\n**Decisions (ROUND 1)**\n\n**ACCEPTANCES:**\n\nPenn State\n\nUconn 15k scholarship\n\nUGA\n\nUMass Lowell  25k scholarship\n\nIllinois Tech 25k scholarship\n\nSuny Buffalo\n\n**REJECTIONS (A LOT)**\n\nYale\n\nBrown\n\nTufts\n\nJohn Hopkins\n\nRice (never paid app fee)\n\nBrown (I wrote six essays for them)\n\nRIT\n\nVanderbilt\n\nCMU (didn't pay app fee, plus why did I apply here when I needed aid)\n\nSyracuse (never got my decision back)\n\nHoward\n\nUofH ad USF (deleted my application cause I was not going to pay app fees)\n\n**DEFERRALS**\n\nTulane- Deferred (they said finances)-Rejected\n\n**DECISIONS ROUND 2!!!**\n\n**Acceptances**\n\nUW Madison- still waiting for King Morgridge Scholarship result - rejected \ud83e\udd79\n\nCatholic University- (I DID NOT WANT TO APPLY HERE BUT MY MUM KNOWS BEST, I really wasted a slot with this school)- 27k scholarship/ the most expensive school even after the money \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nUniversity of Kentucky- 5k scholarship, did not want to pay to send my scores\n\nRutgers\n\nUconn (Storrs) 15k scholarships, reapplied cause I thought I had a place with STAMPS \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nNJIT- thought I had a chance at the honors college scholarship\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nArizona State- 13k scholarship\n\nUniversity of South Dakota- 2.5k scholarship (my best bet, for now)\n\nSaint Louis- 37k scholarship\n\nIllinois Tech- I am so dumb for reapplying here- 25k scholarship\n\nUniversity of Calgary- 1.5k scholarship\n\n**DEFERRED**\n\nPurdue- Accepted, My LOCI is probably what made them reconsider. (told them I had learned new things like crocheting and hair braiding, cooking and baking, and tennis too)-COMMITTED \n\nUmiami- Rejected (they want 98k from me \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80)\n\nUmich- (will probably get rejected too cause I am not paying app fees)\n\n**REJECTED**\n\nCase Western, my first rejection too. Went back to sleep after\n\nGeorgia Tech- knew I had no chance, my mum wanted me to apply\n\nUniversity of Rochester- liked the school but I understand why I got rejected (AID!)\n\n**Waiting:**\n\nCornell-rejected\n\nPenn-rejected\n\nWake Forest-Rejected \ud83e\udef6\n\nBoston University- Rejected \ud83e\udd79\n\nI also applied to UofH and UNT again (\"my mother knows best\")- but I am not paying any app fees so they\u2019ll never read it.\n\nApplied to NCAT but I can\u2019t pay 100 dollars for transcript evaluation, liked the school though\n\n**MY TAKEAWAYS**\n\nI am honestly happy with the acceptances I got from the public universities, I know it's tough for internationals and all, but I can see I am not a bad applicant. I have learned that I should not let AO's opinions affect how I see myself\n\nI am trying to have a positive mindset for the rest of my schools.\n\nI also learned a lot about myself this year, even though my mental health is suffering slightly.\n\nand I am HAPPY to finally start school again and step away from my family.\n\nI love them and all but I feel distance will make my relationship better, especially with my mum.\n\nWishing you all the best, don\u2019t let what some random people think about you from a piece of paper affect you, you are a literal star.\n\nSincerely\n\nAn international applicant"

I talked about how I used to not ask questions for fear of making myself look dumb in front of my classmates, but having a job forced me to ask questions.

LOR could've def been stronger tho after reading it.\n2. **College Stats Lecturer 8.5/10**: Very good relationship and always knew I had a passion for learning math. Did very well in her class. Sat in front of class so I got to talk with her a lot directly and develop a good relationship\n3. **College Government Lecturer 8.5/10**: Also very good relationship and great interactions in and out of the classroom about discussion in government, my heritage, medicine.

Got to talk with him about my ecs, passions, and involvements for LORs and knew I was very motivated\n\n**Interviews**:\n\n**Denison** 10/10: LOVED MY INTERVIEWER SO MUCH. Helped me calm my nerves before I started b/c I lowkey forgot I signed up for one during my visit but we ended up having a conversation that lasted towards an hour. Got to talk about my passions and pride with heritage and went on tangents about coffee and the history of Ethiopia. Sent me a nice letter in the mail afterwards about it too.\n\n**Princeton** 8/10: my interviewer was a retired lawyer so even tho i had interests in stem, we went on tangents about public policy, personal experiences with politics and making/connecting with old friends. spoke for 45 min and it naturally felt like 2 friends having a convo. said i had great confidence and good answers! also gave me a lot of suggestions about what to do/explore if i do end up going.\n\n**Dartmouth:** 8.5/10: interview lasted about an hour and my interviewer was a psych prof at the uni i did research at and was class of 64 from dartmouth. he was surprisingly impressed by my resume and the amount of activities i did as he went through each one on the copy i gave him. talked a lot about my research and the program i started . also got to talk a lot about my heritage and growing up FGLI for part of the interview and he seemed very interested in. asked if ed'd there but hoped i would get in. suggested id be a really good fit given i was interested in environmental studies and looking for tight-knit community.\n\n**Cornell**: 6/10: nothing too special and significant. my interviewer was on call in his car and basically said that the interview was just supposed to be informational. just explained to me why i should come to cornell and asked if i have any questions about the campus/programs\n\n**Essays**:\n\n**Common App**: 9/10 I LOVE MY ESSAY SO MUCH and a lot of people liked it too. talked about niche hobby i had about crushing rocks when i was like 6. connected it to my passions for environmental sci. as well as a cool metaphor for getting closer with my culture.\n\n**Supps; 7-8/10**: Reused a lot since I applied to 28 schools. Believe they displayed my passions well but some were definite hits and others were somewhat misses because I tend to ramble. Tried to be as creative as possible tho\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n***Acceptances***\n\nHoward- EA w/ 20k\n\nPurdue- EA w/ honors+10k\n\nTuskegee- EA w/ full ride\n\nWingate- EA w/ 30K\n\nMiami Uni.- EA w/ honors+13k\n\nOSU- w/ honors+ full tution (top choice rn+ likely gonna commit)\n\nPenn State\n\nDenison w/ 25k (another top choice)\n\nUCincy\n\nBowling Green w/ 10k\n\nEastern Michigan w/ 8k\n\nODU w/ 21k\n\nUDayton w/ 31k\n\nWittenberg w/ 30k\n\n***Rejections\\*:\\****\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\n***Awaiting***\n\nHarvard\n\nYale\n\nPrinceton\n\nDartmouth\n\nCornell\n\nUPenn\n\nStanford\n\nUMich\n\nJHU\n\n**Additional Info**:\n\n\\-I moved schools like twice, once because I moved neighborhoods after being virtual freshman year and twice because I enrolled in a career tech program for my major at another high school. Because of this program and moving schools after being virtual for COVID, I had credit transferring and scheduling issues which limited my # of APs I could take pretty much all 4 years. Overall, I wanted to still challenge myself over the years so my rigor increased with honors and DE classes while still maintaining my GPA. I also did this b/c I though I was gonna go to my state school anyway\ud83d\udc80. I made sure to explain this in my add. info and had my counselor talk about it in LOR.\n\n\\-I mentioned in my add. info that I'm taking Coursera courses in Calc 1 and Gen chem in my free time since I could not fit them in my schedule. Don't know if that's helpful tho.\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nI am actually boggled at the fact I got straight rejected from CWRU considering it was my dream school for 3 years. Ik many people who were test op with less ecs and gpas than me who got accepted and even waitlisted so the rejection genuinely surprised me. I mean I knew I wasn't gonna go anyway cus it was too expensive and I understand no student is entitled to an acceptance but this rejection lowkey stings. Hopefully, the other schools come out better though."

        "post": "I\u2019ve been rejected from every college I\u2019ve applied to, including Colorado Boulder, George Mason, Towson, and more. I have a 2.6 GPA and a 1450 SAT score. The deficiency in my GPA was induced by my sophomore and Junior years. I was repeatedly sexually assaulted and abused by a classmate as a 10th grader and ended up developing a kidney disease which put me in a hospital for the rest of the year. When my dad found out about the incident, he blamed me for it kicked me out, and forced me to live with my uncle, who has lung cancer, as his caretaker. I had to take on three jobs and was working between 10-12 hours a day. My GPA subsequently suffered, although I did manage to squeeze out a surprisingly decent SAT score without any preparation or studying beforehand.\n\nIn my freshman year, I had a 4.3 GPA and took three AP classes, acing all of them. I was on varsity cross country/track and placed at states, won a county-wide hackathon, won a gold key from Scholastic, was a writer and editor on my multiple county publications, won some pretty competitive writing competitions, and was selected to serve on the leadership counsel of an international youth-led non-profit. I was Ivy-bound before I had even finished the last semester of my freshman year. I hoped that my performance as a freshman would denote some academic prowess, but I guess I was incorrect.\n\nI applied to all the high-acceptance rate schools in my region and received rejections from all of them. I\u2019m a big English guy and am pretty great at writing essays, but I guess they just couldn\u2019t redress my GPA. \n\nI\u2019ve applied to a handful of Ivies and T20 schools in hopes of a serendipitous acceptance, but I\u2019m aware that is naive and improbable.  \n\nI know there's no shame in going to community college, but I feel like so much has been stolen from me. Maybe that's entitled of me to proclaim, but none of what happened to me was in my control. None of it is fair. I worked so hard only for none of it to matter at all.\n\nAnd to think my abuser gets away with it all. He faced no repercussions for what he did to me. Even thinking about it makes me furious to the point of self-suffocation, my breath contorting in rage inside me. I can\u2019t fathom any of it. I can\u2019t believe my own father blamed me for it and sacked me from my own house.\n\nI just feel so quashed. I poured my heart into my Common App essay, and all of it was for nothing. I\u2019m lost and wounded, and the worst part of it all, I never actually got the opportunity to heal from the trauma he inflicted upon me. I\u2019ve been in a perennial fight for survival, I haven\u2019t even gotten the opportunity to live. And now my life is ruined.\n\nWhat do I even do to quench this anger? To make sense of this suffering?"

Last year was one of the worst years of my life as I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. I had to drop out of my last college, but I'm feeling better now. I felt hopeless for a very long time, but now I'm starting to feel like things are looking up for me again! \n\n\rRegardless, however, the biggest takeaway I would like my readers to make from this post is to never give up! Kenyon waitlisted me last year and I never thought I would get in, but I did! it doesn't matter if you need a gap year like I did, as long as you go at your own pace that's all that matters. You will achieve good things in your life if you work for it. And even if you don't get an amazing scholarship, that doesn't define you! Search for better opportunities like I did.  Don't fall into comparing yourself to others on this sub.\n\nAnyways that's all I got folks. Bye!\n\n\r"

ESSAYS. INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITIES) which are MAJOR, MAJOR factors as to whether u get in. it is seriously sm more than stats/ecs. and also understand that these same subjective parts might be the same ones that are out of your control. college apps encompass so many diff factors that's impossible to control for all and maximize your possible \"chances\". if i'd listened to chances i would've never applied to mit.\n2. if ur still in early years of high school i genuinely think there is no better advice than to find what you love and then do it well. at the beginning of hs i was admittedly concerned about college prestige... and then i realized i literally loved math and didn't care where i went as long as i could pursue it fully. then i started doing random math related stuff and becoming friends w ppl who also loved math and we ended up just working on a bunch of cool stuff together. petey says it best on [applying sideways](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/)\n3. deferral/rejection is not the end of the road. i know a stanford deferral is a very good sign and so I'm def in a lucky position to be saying this, but i mean this not in the context of admissions, but in terms of personal peace and confidence. i know what it feels like to get edged by your dream school - and this goes for literally any school - the process is full of so many contingents that it is not worth beating yourself up for because sm of it is out of control. focus on what you can control - and that's yourself and what you do next, including beyond the app process and into college.\n\nif anyone wants to reach out or has any questions about literally anything, DM me. i am still in shock about everything and am by no means an AO/admissions expert or anything like that but if my personal experiences can prove relatable or helpful to anyone else, i'd be happy to be of service.\n\n&#x200B;"

        "post": "Hey everyone! Right now, Duke is my top choice for college. The full tuition they're offering as an in-state student from North Carolina (my family makes under $150k) is just too good to pass up. Plus, the Duke football coaches said they could potentially negotiate some additional aid to make it a complete full ride if I commit as a preferred walk-on. I would probably have to pay more for Berkeley MET, Stanford, and Yale compared to Duke approximately 30-40k more per year. I got into Stanford REA and I got into Berkeley early as well. The Duke Football Coach said I am probably going to get into Duke as academically I'm very strong and for Yale I just recently received a likely letter.\r  \n\r  \nPlaying football in college would be amazing, but I'm also cool if it doesn't work out. My main goal is to start a tech/finance startup or go into venture capital and private equity after graduating.\r  \n\r  \nI'm really worried about the missed opportunities I pass up on more prestigious schools like Stanford or Yale. I'm planning on getting my real estate license by the summer and starting my own company. If I stay in-state, I can continue my company as I'll be local but if I go out-of-state, it'll be very hard for me to do so.\r  \n\r  \nWhat's really appealing to me about Duke is the collaborative environment and fun social scene. I don't want anything too intense academically - I'm looking for a good balance of academics and college life. Stanford and Yale seem a bit more rigorous from what I've heard.\r  \n\r  \nDuke just seems like the perfect fit - affordable, great for entrepreneurship and finance, D1 football, and a laid-back but engaged student culture. The startup founders like the Coinbase, Neuralink, and Plaid guys coming from Duke is also super inspiring.\r  \n\r  \nI'm definitely leaning towards locking in my commitment to Duke. The full ride is hard to beat, and it checks all my other boxes too but so do Stanford and Yale. But I'm still doing my research, so let me know if you all have any other insights! Getting an outside perspective is really helpful as I make this big decision.\r  \n\r  \n"

I was also one of 12 students to receive an A for a world studies EE. Finally, I was named as one of my school's scholars (honour roll equivalent I think??).\n\n**Letters of Recommendation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I won't rate cause I never read any of them lol, as well as because the whole US system is unfamiliar to all of my teachers.IB Coordinator/College Counsellor** \u2013 Loved her!\n\n**History teacher** \u2013 Loved him and his class, I was a very active and engaged student!\n\n**Maths teacher** \u2013 Loved her, and her class alone is the reason why I might continue with maths classes in the future. I had a zero to hero story in this class (started off getting 3s & struggling, ended with a 6!)\n\n**Literature teacher** \u2013 Loved him, and was active in this class too\n\n**Music teacher / Choir coordinator** \u2013 Have a very strong bond with her, and enjoyed all her classes & singing!\n\n**Interviews (all virtual)**\n\n**Princeton** \u2013 6/10. This was my first interview so I was quite nervous, but I think I gave adequate responses & also asked good questions.\n\n**Northwestern** \u2013 8/10. This interview went really well! My interview was super nice and friendly, and I felt like I shared literally everything about me lol and she seemed interested.\n\n**Minerva** \u2013 >!Had to cancel on her after being accepted elsewhere...!<\n\nHamilton Hello \u2013 8/10. 2 minute spontaneous thing, you get the drill.\n\nSwarthmore Video \u2013 8/10. Another 2 minute spontaneous thing. These were both kinda fun!\n\nUChicago & Brown Video\u00a0\u2013 9/10 (I'm really proud of this one!). I showed them what its like to live in Australia as well as sharing other 'quirky' details about myself.\n\n**Essays**\n\n**Common App Essay (Reflect on a time when you questioned...)** \u00a0\u2013\u00a0I wrote about my journey in advocacy, particularly highlighting how I overcame and learned from challenges with my bicycling campaign. I spent quite alot of time on this one, & I think it was an 8/10\n\n**Community disruption essay** \u2013 talked about how my city has been affected by climate change, linked it to my interest in the issue, climate activism & as well as my identity as an Australian. This one was natural to write and I think was an 9/10\n\n**The frequently asked essay questions (e.g. community**): I talked about my experiences with the jazz community, which is welcoming and inherently democratic. I then linked it to my interests in climate activism, making sure to weave in details specific to the college! Generally 7-8/10. For other answers (e.g. love of learning style ones) I talked about how I enjoyed researching my extended essay, and my academics, and other things.\n\n**Why Us essays**: I generally spent a while searching through their academic programs, offerings, and student orgs to find ones that matched my interests in environmentalism, public policy, music, opportunities, service learning, etc. Generally 7-8/10.\n\n**Quirky essays:** I just tried to be authentic as possible. Generally 8/10.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD**\n\nAustralian National University \u2013 >!(Admissions work differently here, but I maxed out the selection rank whoopee & was accepted into a prestigious program) > I accepted & deferred a year planning to cancel!<\n\nPrinceton REA \u2013 >!Rejected!<\n\nOberlin Conservatory \u2013 >!Rejected (To be fair, I didn't complete the application! Applying here was my biggest regret lol)!<\n\nUMichigan \u2013\u00a0>!Deferred!<\n\nUChicago ED2 \u2013\u00a0>!Accepted!!! Woohooo!!!!!!<\n\n>!Withdrawn:Amherst, Brown, Cornell, Hamilton, Harvard, Middlebury, NYU, Northeastern, Northwestern, Oberlin College, Pomona, Swarthmore, Tufts, UMich, Wesleyan, Williams, Yale, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Minerva!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Comments:** Do I wish I shotgunned even though I >!was accepted ED!<? Not at all! There was no guarantee that I was going to get in anywhere and so I was absolutely speechless when I opened my >!UChicago decision!<. Besides, I learnt a lot about myself through all of these applications and I feel like I understand myself, my preferences and my interests better now.\n\nMy advice to future applicants: follow your interests, and take every opportunity you get. Go as deep as you can go into what you enjoy and your application will naturally take shape. I never really knew I wanted to delve into politics that much, and it was a series of spontaneous decisions that led me to really dive deep in it.\n\nAlso, this whole admissions process is way more unpredictable & random than you might realise. It's not like the Australian system, where all you need is to meet the grade cutoff for your intended course to get in. There are a whole host of factors that you cannot control. Nepo babies can pretty much buy their way in to many of the most prestigious places with niche sports and million dollar college advisors. I never had any kind of college advisor apart from binging CollegeMeister YT videos, let alone anyone at my school that were familiar with the US system!\n\nAnyway, I hope someone found this useful. Feel free to ask questions in comments or DMs, and good luck for the rest of the class of 28's decisions! Go Maroons!"

Georgetown was considered a target/safety, as 100% of kids with similar statistics from my school, 94 GPA 1510+ have been accepted. I have no cracked extra-curriculars, in fact none of them actually relate to my major. I can't help but feel that Ive cheated this process and dont deserve to attend these schools. It feels like my families success is one of the only reasons I can actually hope to get into these schools."

What I've seen is a majority of posts on this sub are from extremely exceptional applicants with either tremendous or really concerning college results. I've also seen some not-so-strong applicants post really lucky college results. While I don't want to shun anyone who wants to share their results on this sub, it's not healthy for a lot of the readers on the sub to continue being regular readers.\n\nIt's a lot like social media, where we can't help but subconsciously compare ourselves with others. They might have more followers, the better body, more money, gotten really lucky, etc. The point is, we come in looking for something good (catching up with friends, watching funny memes, etc), but end up leaving more hurt than before.  The same is true here. We come in looking for what kind of stats + ECs are getting people into top colleges or what kind of colleges are people getting into with similar stats to you. But, over time, we end up leaving discouraged, tense, overconfident, or just generally a bit shitty.\n\nIt's a cool idea to have a comprehensive, open-source catalog of college results. But for readers of this sub, keep in mind this fair warning. If you're just on this sub after applying and feeling anxious about what colleges you can get into, this sub is probably not for you. Same for prospective applicants who are about to apply and can't really do anything about their stats and ECs. I don't really think this sub helps prospective applicants who still have some time before they apply, but that probably depends more. As a rule of thumb, if you're just not feeling it when visiting this sub (you know yourself best if you're honest with yourself), it's not worth being on this sub."

Please note that with all scholarships/financial aid, both schools come to pretty much the same cost. Here are my pros and cons of each school: \nUSC Pros: Closer to home, my high school research mentor will be at Keck allowing us to continue our research, 50% off tuition, love the campus, love the weather, and I love the Human Biology courses! \nUSC Cons: I\u2019ve heard that the USC curriculum is designed to be weed out, and I heard that getting clinical opportunities in LA can be a little hard. \nUNC Pros: So many clinical opportunities, part of the NC research triangle, has an academic hospital in walking distance, and overall is a \u201cmore premed oriented\u201d school. \nUNC Cons: Far from home, and I honestly like the USC campus and coursework better. \nI\u2019m really confused as to what to pick, so just wanted to know your guys\u2019 thoughts and feedback."

I was never really excited about any of my colleges until I went on visits this weekend. I'm from New York and we first went to Elon in North Carolina which I really liked but there's nothing really around Elon and is definitely a smaller school which I don't know how into that I am. Then we went to Coastal and I instantly felt so happy and like this was a place I really belonged. With Elon there was barely any students walking around but at Coastal it was such a vibrant and happy environment with students laughing and skateboarding.\nImmediately after my tour of Coastal I went on the commits page and stated talking with people who are committed there because I was just so excited for the first time about college. I am a beach girl at heart and since i'm from NY I love that the weather isn't as cold down there and that the beach is close. However, my only hesitation about Coastal is that it doesn't have the best reputation. Uri I visited last summer so l don't remember that much about it but i'm sure it's a nice school but it's just maybe a little too close to home and same weather as home which I really want to escape. I don't want to say i'm a crazy party animal but l definitely love to party every weekend and I thrive on social activities. Not sure if Elon is the best place for that but I also plan on rushing. Coastal also has a scuba diving club which I really want to join because I love to scuba dive. I really fell in love with coastal but I know Elon is also such a great school that I also enjoyed when I visited. Overall I could use some people's opinion on where I should go and why. Any help is appreciated thank you!"

I don\u2019t think my test scores are outstanding by any means but I decided to submit them because I know that they\u2019re good compared to my school\u2019s average, and considering that I\u2019m FGLI I think? Really hoping that the schools I applied to consider that but we\u2019ll see \ud83d\ude4f"

Spent a lot of time with him in my junior year, but not as much in my senior year. I think he knows me enough to talk about my work ethic and my general intelligence at school.\n\nCommerce Teacher (8/10): Spent a lot of 1 on 1 time with this teacher. Really knows me and watched me relentlessly try to get better in areas I struggled in earlier. Has said good things about me in the past. \n\nCEO of Social Startup (9.5/10): Optional LOR from the CEO of the startup I worked at for 1.5 years. Has become a good family friend over the years. Has always spoken extremely highly of me. Said one of the most passionate/enthusiastic people he's worked with. Delighted to write an LOR for me. Know for a fact he wrote very highly of me.    \n\n  \n**Interviews**\r  \n\r  \nPrinceton (8/10): Interviewer seemed to connect well with me. Spent a lot more time talking about Princeton as a school over me but managed to turn the conversation to connect both. Told him about my values and my passions and he seemed to get it. Overall wasn't awkward and interview sailed smoothly.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n**Essays**\n\n\r  \nCommon App Essay (8.5/10): One of the first essays I've wrote. Done about 5 drafts before settling on the one I have now. No weird gimmicks or trying to stand out. Was as raw as possible and just put my heart into the essay. Think it got across my passion very well. \n\nUSC Supplements (8.5/10): These were obviously very random. I think my why USC essay was very solid, while the other short answers displayed a solid amount of personality. Obviously, it worked lol. \n\nUMich Supplements (9/10): I genuinely feel like I aced the 550 word why UMich Essay. Both the essays I was very proud of, and I'm pretty sure played a massive role in what I wanted to put forward in my application as a whole. \n\n\r\r  \n\r**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\r  \n\r  \n**Acceptances:**\r  \n\r  \nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbour (Film, Television, and Media) EA\n\nUniversity of Southern California, Marshall School of Business (Business of Cinematic Arts) EA\n\n\r\r\r  \n**Waiting On**\n\n\r  \nPrinceton\n\nHarvard\n\nYale\n\nUPenn\n\nDuke\n\nNorthwestern\n\nDartmouth\n\nBrown\n\nVanderbilt\n\nRice\n\nWashU at St. Louis\n\nCornell\n\nColumbia\n\nNYU\n\nURochester\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nBoston University\n\n\r\r\r  \nOverall, I'm very happy with my decisions already. I believe my Ivy + T10 supplemental essays were even better than my USC or UMich ones (really got into the groove of writing by Regular Decision) and so I'm very optimistic about those.

Chick-Fil-A Leadership Academy; again, didn't really do much but we did a carnival type impact project for younger kids in our community \n8. Held a job from summer before Junior year to present.

National Hispanic Recognition Program \n4. United Nations Association Community Service Merit Award (got through NHS volunteer hours)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\n1. Debate Coach 8/10\nI felt like she knew about me well enough to sell me well, she was also my AP Lang teacher. I honestly wasn't sure but I recently got to read the letter she wrote and I felt proud with the way she focused on my academics and attitude towards school, felt like she really conveyed my passion for learning. \n\n2. AP Chem teacher 6/10\nProbably a very generic letter, I loved his class and had him as my teacher for Honors chem the year before AP Chem so he knew me pretty well just not on a personal level. I asked him kind of last minute because I didn realize the questbridge deadline was so close. I wasn't planning on asking him for one but QB required 2 core-class teacher rec letters. \n\n**Interviews**\n\nNone. \n\n**Essays**\n\n**QB Essay 1**\nTopic: Please describe how the most influential factors and challenges in your life have shaped you into the person you are today. 722/800 words. \n\nWrote about and compared my way of thinking to Orwell's Doublethink; really focused on how I often question myself but am hyper-confident the next moment. I honestly thought I sounded schizophrenic while writing it but I think the AO was able to place themselves in my shoes and that's how it conveyed the kind of person I was. \n\n**QB Prompt 2**\nTopic: Tell us about a concept, theory, or topic you have explored simply because it sparked your intellectual curiosity. Why do you find it intriguing? How do you want to explore it further? Words:499/500\n\nFocused on the discovery of the New World, showing my fascination and horrified response to the genocide of Native Americans. I connected this instance to myself and my own ancestry; even though I don't identify or am classified as N.A., I find it sad how my ancestors **were** N.A but that it was essentially bred out of existence. Using this, I showed how passionate I was towards history and studying more about me and my ancestors past culture. \n\nShort Answers: I did a pretty good job at staying focused on my interest in government and law. \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n\ud83d\udc02University of Texas @ Austin \ud83d\udc02: accepted on November 31 to Government major. Honestly was expecting to get in because of my EC's and top 6% automatic in-state acceptance. \n\n\ud83e\udd81Columbia University\ud83e\udd81: Received QB acceptance on December 1st during psych class, was honestly shocked because I ranked it third and didn't know much about it \ud83e\udd2a (that ivy prestige got to me). But, I must say that it seems like a perfect match for me after ive learned a lot more about it, especially it's Core Curriculum and literature studies. \n\n*Rejections:*\n\n\ud83d\udca9Yale & Brown\ud83d\udca9: applied to both through QB and ranked as first & second respectively. Wasn't matched so technically a soft rejection, still salty \ud83d\ude44\n\nNote: I was planning on applying to some other top Texas colleges, but I was pretty dead set on going to UT, I didn't even apply to out of state schools because of tuition costs. This is where my bumpkin ignorance showed most, as I didn't even know about prominent universities apart from ivies (first time I heard about Boston University was when I watched the Social Network)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI think the biggest factor in all this was my location. Specifically, my school has a lot of unmotivated students that generally don't try; even top ranked kids don't shoot too far and land somewhere local/easy to get into with Texas' automatic acceptance law (think A&M, amazing school that is also rural and doesn't require getting out of comfort zone). \n\nAfaik, I'm around the fifth kid in my school's history to go to an ivy, with the most recent being an athlete signing to Columbia roughly 3 years back. \n\nQuestBridge was honestly such an amazing opportunity and even though it was hard and I wanted to just drop it a couple times, I'm super glad I stuck with my application and didn't settle for less.

We\u2019ve talked pretty extensively for all the years she\u2019s worked here, and she\u2019s seen me gone from a crazy stressed and overwhelmed junior to me slaying in my senior season rn. She knows me p well, and even when I was 20 missing assignments deep last year, her first impression of me was that I was so incredibly organized, put together, and dedicated & passionate about what I love (couch couch, theater and the rest of my ECs). She\u2019s seen how the brain spice has affected me and how I\u2019ve grown, and I can guarantee she covered it all in her letter.  \n**AP Stat Teacher:** I needed an academic rec and she delivered!!!!! My best friend and I were in her class junior year and brought her the daily tea from our theater company. I struggled so hard in her class, but tried so so hard and she knew. She\u2019s so funny and I love her sm.  \n**Media Services Technician/Club Sponsor/Boss/Mentor:** Okay so like. He and I are like this \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e.

Once I sat down to write it, it kinda just all flowed out. My essay was about linguistic accuracy and specificity in describing personal identity, parallels between myself and Percy Jackson in regards to split heritage (hate that word \ud83d\udc80) & split belonging, the insatiable & irrational desire to find the words that are \\*just right\\* to describe myself + general illogical chase of perfection (teehee I wonder which brain spice I can attribute that to), my love for ancient Greek history and linguistics, and the profound impact of my mom rejecting her multiethnicity to this day. Everyone who read it (including the AP Lit teacher I TA for) all really liked it!\n\n**Decisions (all EA/Rolling for Pitt)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Temple University ($14k/yr Founder's Scholarship)\n* Depaul University ($29k/yr Presidential Scholarship\u2014more than the max for incoming freshies!!)\n* University of Pittsburgh\n* Emerson College (with zero aid, woohoo!)\n* Ithaca College ($27k/yr scholarship)\n\n*Waitlists:*  \nNone!\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UMD (damn, the $30k/yr in-state school without my major! heartbroken)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nMy father passed down that sweet, sweet combo of depression, OCD, and autism! Trying to deal with all that + his same issues while unmedicated sophomore/junior year absolutely tanked my grades last year (collected every letter of the rainbow\u2026.), but now chemistry is doing its good work \ud83d\ude0c Mentioned all this on my apps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHeaded to Chicago!!!! Go DePaul Blue Demons!! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude08  \nHolistic review really is holistic, girlypops! I got really worried that colleges were going to toss my app the second they saw the full alphabet of grades on my transcript, but all\u2019s well that ends well!\n\nI\u2019ll be going to school in a big city, in a rarely-offered program I love with a faculty of super knowledgeable & passionate nerds, freaking taking a Harry Potter lit class for gened English credit, hopefully eventually doing the Doctor Who study abroad program, and literally surrounded by bookshops. Best of all, I\u2019ll be going to school with my best friend + living with the person who makes me happier than anything. Really couldn\u2019t ask for more :)"

It was about my rice noodle cooking experience in parallel with how I learned coding. I think writing about something you truly love in the personal statement is important because I had the mindset that if a college rejects a personal statement about RICE NOODLES they don't deserve my time anyways \\*smug\\*.\n\nIdentity essay: (7/10) I wrote about the absence of my dad in my life and how that led me to take on more masculine roles -> stem. I kinda liked how taking on familial roles also ties in with my cooking experience.\n\nLOR:\n\nmath teacher: (7/10) I really liked his class and considering how like he chose me from some other students I think it was pretty alright. But since I don't really hang out with my teachers I'm capping this at 7. \n\nhistory: (5/10) possibly my worst subject bc I have no hope with liberal artsy stuff.

My original app materials were prob not that good cuz I only got in some public schools (which prob cares less abt essays) (not sure). \n\nUNC ea - surprised about this but then oos is kind of crazy\n\nDeferred:\n\nUSC viterbi ea - no feelings abt this one\n\nnortheastern ea - applied cuz it was free :/\n\n  \nAdditional Information:\n\nI feel so under qualified to get in like UIUC cs and JHU but I am processing it. SOOOO HAPPY TO BE A BLUEJAY. Kind of scared of Baltimore at the moment. Also also guys don't listen to your counselors apply to the schools you like. Out of my EAs the hardest to get in was probably UIUC cs (which my counselor told me was impossible) but I GOT INNNN. And then they also told me to drop jhu cuz it's impossible. I feel like my application was very average compared to the competitive applicants out there so really do make use of the Eas/ED. Luck in college apps is reallll I think I've used up all my luck for this and I have no regrets. Alsoalso I know jhu cs is good but considering how good they are for premeds, should I consider switching into premed? Does anyone know how that works? I like computer science but it doesn't hafts be pure cs considering the job market out there."

Guidance Counselor : absolutely loved her, was completely honest with her at all times and i was often commended for being able to stand up for myself and always being sure of myself and my interests, and that was likely reflected in my letter! i had a lot of attendance issues in HS due to commute and mental health reasons that she was aware of, but she encouraged me to take a day off each week if I needed it, it wouldn't kill me esp bc I did so well in school even while I was out\n\n2. US History Teacher: he was a popular teacher for rec letters so I was one of the 25 chosen from about 100+ ish students? mostly because I kept my grades high and always turned in work on time and showed good qualities when offering to help students in our class w/ work or offering to help him put stuff up outside of school, a lot of our assignments allowed for me to really analyze and make connections between the content and current events and knowledge from other classes. he had a form to complete that asked a LOT about me, and he specifically responded to me highlighting that it was great to learn about my travels to Bangladesh, my interest in cats/cosplay, the games I enjoy playing, etc. \n\n3. AP Lang Teacher: honestly didn't get TOO close with him, but i was not very close w/ my teachers overall but he knew me probably the second best because of my writing and when we talked about college essays in the spring semester, he liked me a lot because of my interest in taking care of stray cats and interest in the books/podcasts recommended about addiction/social justice/the effects of social media/etc. stuff like that! lot of the stuff we read in his class was fun and i got to show my interest in that through our work\n\n\r  \n\r  \n**Interviews**\r  \n\r  \nOnly had one w/ my Hampshire admissions counselor, very casual and I just talked more about myself, my interests which are evidently video games, cats, mental health, art, etc.. Introduced my cat to her LOL and she just told me a bit about her own experiences @ Hampshire and things that make Hampshire stand out from other schools and if she thinks I would be a good fit based on that, and then she answered questions I had ! I'd just ask stuff about the single dorms, pets on campus, what wild animals were on campus since it's a rural area LOL\r\n\n\r\r\r  \n\n\n**Essays**\r  \n\r  \n(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\nTime Spent: I spent a lot of time on my personal statement, started brainstorming ideas all the way since sophomore year, but of course I spent the most time in junior year & the summer. I got revisions from my AP Lang teacher at first, changed up the idea a bit and zoomed in more, and then went to friends and my AP Lit teacher. Since NYU was my latest deadline, I did actually get another opinion from a friend who looked over both my supplemental for NYU and main essay and we revamped it together a LOT to provide more insight, more personality, etc. \n\nTopic-- Personal Statement: Without being too specific, I did the gratitude prompt, and talked about how much I hated being asked the question \"How are you?\" and provide a specific anecdote involving the first meeting with my guidance counselor. I quickly warmed up to her though, and then later described how she was an inspiration for my current pursuit of a career in BOTH education/counseling. I wanna be a guidance counselor like her, and I just described some of the small actions I've been taking towards showing people that I care about them, cause I want to replicate her actions and how she made me feel all with the end goal of providing a solid support system to others the way she did for me :) \n\nTopic-- NYU Supplemental, my strongest: In response to the Lang quote, I talked about my experiences as an art student, and how I soared when it came to MAKING art, but I needed to learn how to walk in terms of UNDERSTANDING art. I provide a specific anecdote about my confusion in Art History, but I reflect on how that class gave me so much knowledge that I became fond of the connections between art and culture. I wasn't so much focused on being amazing at art, I was just fond of it from the audience's perspective now, and being able to make art enhanced that too! I made connections to NYU's campus at the end too, specifically elements of Washington Square Park that related to what I learned in Art History.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n\r\r**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\r  \n\r  \nAcceptances:\n\n\\- New York University Steinhardt (ED2)\r  \n\r  \n\\- Fordham University (EA)\n\n\\- Hampshire College (EA)\r  \n\r  \n\\- Hunter College CUNY\r  \n\r  \n\\- UMass Amherst (EA)\r  \n\r  \nDeferrals:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Northeastern (EA)\r  \n\r  \nRejections/Waitlists: N/A\r  \n\r\r  \n\r\r"

I locked in on my far reach school essays and tweaked them for schools I didn't care as much about.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAcceptances:\n\nArizona State Barrett Honors EA (In-State Tuition and 16.5k a year)\n\nArizona Franke Honors EA (In-State Tuition and 18k a year)\n\nMinnesota Honors EA (15k a year)\n\nAlabama EA (Full Tuition, 1k per year, First Year Housing)\n\nHouston Honors EA (In-State Tuition and 7k a year)\n\nCentral Florida EA (9.5k per year)\n\nMichigan State Honors EA (20k per year)\n\nTexas A&M EA\n\nOklahoma EA (abt 28.5k per year)\n\nPittsburgh EA\n\nSouth Carolina EA (Scholarship not released)\n\nIndiana Honors EA (18k per year, waiting on more scholarship program information)\n\nClemson EA (Scholarship not released)\n\nGeorgia EA\n\nTennessee EA (13k per year)\n\nHoward EA (20k per year)\n\nCU Boulder EA\n\nNorth Carolina A&T EA\n\nUMiami EA (22k per year)\n\nMaryland EA (Letters and Sciences)\n\nRejections:\n\nUNC\n\nUT Austin\n\nGA Tech\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nStill have some scholarship stuff pending before I make a final decision, but I think I did alright with my stats. I'll more than likely end up in another state (which I would prefer). I don't care as much about prestige as I once did, and I hope that some of you open your eyes to the possibilities when you open yourself up to opportunities. At the end of the day you make the education, not the school you attend."

Guess this proves that you don\u2019t need straight A\u2019s to get into a reputable uni!\n\nI also wanted to point out that applying to comprehensive uni\u2019s as a visual arts major has not appeared as a popular option for many, since most of the art major profiles I scrolled through were of students applying to art school specifically. Therefore, I would like to add a datapoint here in hopes of posing a reference for future visual arts students who are looking to apply to general uni\u2019s ;)"

LOR could've def been stronger tho after reading it.\n2. **College Stats Lecturer 8.5/10**: Very good relationship and always knew I had a passion for learning math. Did very well in her class.

Got to talk with him about my ecs, passions, and involvements for LORs and knew I was very motivated\n\n**Interviews**:\n\n**Denison** 10/10: LOVED MY INTERVIEWER SO MUCH. Helped me calm my nerves before I started b/c I lowkey forgot I signed up for one during my visit but we ended up having a conversation that lasted towards an hour. Got to talk about my passions and pride with heritage and went on tangents about coffee and the history of Ethiopia. Sent me a nice letter in the mail afterwards about it too.\n\n**Princeton** 8/10: my interviewer was a retired lawyer so even tho i had interests in stem, we went on tangents about public policy, personal experiences with politics and making/connecting with old friends. spoke for 45 min and it naturally felt like 2 friends having a convo. said i had great confidence and good answers! also gave me a lot of suggestions about what to do/explore if i do end up going.\n\n**Dartmouth:** 8.5/10: interview lasted about an hour and my interviewer was a psych prof at the uni i did research at and was class of 64 from dartmouth. he was surprisingly impressed by my resume and the amount of activities i did as he went through each one on the copy i gave him. talked a lot about my research and the program i started . also got to talk a lot about my heritage and growing up FGLI for part of the interview and he seemed very interested in. asked if ed'd there but hoped i would get in. suggested id be a really good fit given i was interested in environmental studies and looking for tight-knit community.\n\n**Cornell**: 6/10: nothing too special and significant. my interviewer was on call in his car and basically said that the interview was just supposed to be informational. just explained to me why i should come to cornell and asked if i have any questions about the campus/programs\n\n**Essays**:\n\n**Common App**: 9/10 I LOVE MY ESSAY SO MUCH and a lot of people liked it too. talked about niche hobby i had about crushing rocks when i was like 6. connected it to my passions for environmental sci. as well as a cool metaphor for getting closer with my culture.\n\n**Supps; 7-8/10**: Reused a lot since I applied to 28 schools. Believe they displayed my passions well but some were definite hits and others were somewhat misses because I tend to ramble. Tried to be as creative as possible tho\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n***Acceptances***\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\*\n\nState Schools- EA w/ 200k in total\n\nHoward- EA w/ 20k (still waiting on Karsh Scholars results..)\n\nPurdue- EA w/ honors+10k\n\nTuskegee- EA w/ full ride\n\nWingate- EA w/ 30K\n\nMiami Uni.- EA w/ honors+13k\n\nOSU\n\nPenn State\n\n***Rejections\\*:\\****\n\nCase Western PPSP\n\n***Awaiting***\n\nIvys except Columbia b/c of lack of space on common app\n\nStanford\n\nUMich\n\nCWRU (regular)\n\nJHU\n\nDenison\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Info**:\n\n\\-I moved schools like twice, once because I moved neighborhoods after being virtual freshman year and twice because I enrolled in a career tech program for my major at another high school. Because of this program and moving schools after being virtual for COVID, I had credit transferring and scheduling issues which limited my # of APs I could take pretty much all 4 years. Overall, I wanted to still challenge myself over the years so my rigor increased with honors and DE classes while still maintaining my GPA. I also did this b/c I though I was gonna go to my state school anyway\ud83d\udc80. I made sure to explain this in my add. info and had my counselor talk about it in LOR.\n\n\\-I mentioned in my add. info that I'm taking Coursera courses in Calc 1 and Gen chem in my free time since I could not fit them in my schedule. Don't know if that's helpful tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nOverall, I am aware I am not the best t20 applicant out there as many people on reddit have said that time and time again to me but it doesn't hurt to have some hope tbh, especially being first gen. Although I did basically shotgun, I am honestly very content with the schools I have gotten in rn with OSU being my top choice considering their top-notch public-health programs and research opportunities."

In my junior year, I was really into college admissions and I prepared so much for application season, but then at the beginning of my senior year, my father suddenly passed away. This had a huge impact on me and I forgot all about college admissions. A series of unfortunate events following my father's passing led me to lose my house, car and all my belongings, this forced me to move to Canada to live with my Mother. My school was kind enough to let me take online courses and graduate from their school, so I'm not an international applicant. But throughout the application process, I lost my father and my entire life, I can't say admissions has treated me kindly.\n\nFor those of you who are in the application process like me right now or are applying next year, just understand this isn't the end. I always thought undergrad admissions were everything and it wasn't until reality hit in that we have a whole life ahead of us. Don't get too caught up on your acceptances and rejections, just do what you can to enjoy your senior year and get the best college results. I know it's like a broken record, but you'll seriously end up where you're supposed to.\n\n&#x200B;"

It doesn't matter how - but colleges need to have a reason that you would offer something different than every other person applying to their school.

I'm starting a [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@dylanott) where I want to answer any questions you might have throughout the college admissions process. I know that I was confused before this whole process - and don't get me wrong, I still am about certain parts - but I feel like I have a lot of guidance and knowledge that I would love to share. Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll try my best to answer them!"

I got suspended, got it scrubbed and permanently removed so that tanked my junior year grades and I got a C in precalc. Grandma died in a car accident so I missed like the last week of school freshman year and got a C in chem. Got a LOT of Bs from the suspension, I was out of school for like three weeks. Got diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD during that time too. I thought I was absolutely cooked. No SAT, shit grades, I thought my only saving grace was my mediocre ECs, rigor given context, and awards. A lot of my schools were pipe dreams and why-the-hell-not\u2019s. \n\nI fell into patterns of substance abuse, toxic relationships, and such bad mental health. I was also technically the first to get into college, mom got her BA as apart of her job 4 yrs ago, but never went through this process and there\u2019s five of us kids. This is proof you CAN in fact get it done. I am very proud of myself for getting into a selective school and keeping myself as focused as I could given the circumstances, and giving my sister hope to finally see one of her siblings go to college. It is possible \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f you don\u2019t have to let go of your dreams of prestige, selectivity, private education, because of your struggles. \n\nAlso FYI, I did not apply for vassar and nova ED at the same time. Vassar got back to me early with the ED II results, rejected me, therefore I was released from the agreement. I received my Villanova decision shortly before and had a week to decide if I wanted to convert my application to ED II, which I did decide to do. Besides, I\u2019d already mourned those schools and got nearly a full ride at Fordham which was huge. \n\nLmk if you have any questions! Sorry it\u2019s not as impressive as everyone else, you guys are all so smart talented and amazing! This is just my story \ud83e\udd17"

Also my gpa, but I mean I have a reason my mom was hit by a car literally a week into the school year and I do not f\\*vking trust my dad to take care of  my mom because he was so intolerant then. Looking back it feels like I barely did anything even though I was so exhausted, but I never trust any judgement I harbor towards myself because it's probably wrong - can you tell I have self esteem issues? There was just so much going on like quite a few mental health struggles (body issues, executive dysfunction, paranoia my mom would die, silent panic attacks, etc;)\n\nAlso I got help on writing my essay from my local library <- (!! IMPORTANT FOR RISING SENIORS KNOW YOUR LOCAL RESOURCES THEY CAN HELP A TON !!)\n\nThat and become friends with your guidance counselor. Am I saying to like, tell them everything? Absolutely not. But like make them know you, frequent the offices to say hi once in a while, wish them happy holidays etc.\n\nI still can't believe I got into Emory though but here we are and god I am excited for the future - I can dress more freely around campus!! - but also devastated because of graduation and watching my friends leave to their amazing schools and pursuing their dreams."

I've also searched on multiple college course descriptions but I'm still unsure. Can anybody help?"

Very likely about my engagement with him outside the classroom\n* AP Physics teacher (9/10): SUPER close with the dude. Talked about literally everything with him and came to his office hours super often to chat.\n* H. PreCalc teacher (7.5/10): Pretty close with her. DIdn't do the best in her class because of huge spike in family duties junior year. However, improved a LOT throughout the year and she told me how she emphasized that a ton in the rec)\n* Research Mentor (8/10): Super close with him. Harvard Alum. WOrked with him virtually for about a year on my research project. I've read his writing before because he needed to submit a rec for science fairs I was entering. Pretty good imo)\n* Guidance (10/10): Emotional ties with this dude. We connect a lot about sports and I stop by to talk with him nearly every single day. He also lives like a couple blocks away from me every day too so I see him on my train rides to school p often)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* UPenn (Good but i got rejected ED lmao)\n* Harvard (Super well. Got emotional talking about my deceased mom during interview and sobbed a bit)\n* MIT (Kinda iffy. She was like super stern and cold and was criticizing me during the interview. She asked me weird ass questions like \"estimate how many barbers there are in NYC to the power of 10\" and \"if you were a fruit what fruit would you be.\" I though I absolutely fucked the up the interview but at the end she told me she really fucking loved my personality and knows I was under a lot of pressure after the questions so she \"slid me an opportunity under the table\" by giving me an hour after the interview to give her an essay with everyting I would like to rephrase or reword during my interview so she can build the strongest case for me possible)\n* Princeton (BEST one. Spoke for nearly 2.5 hours and found a lot of common interests in sports and poetry. Dude took the train with me home (halfway) and helped with calc hw on the way home)\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Personal Statement (8.5/10): Talked about how I hated Mother's Day growing up but eventually turned it into a day of self-reflection and goal-setting by realizing I could step into the role of a mother figure for my lil sister by listening to what others are appreciative of their mothers for ok Mother\u2019s Day and setting them as goals for the upcoming year. The conclusion was a bit rushed tbh.\n* Supps: I took a TON of risks with my supps. I don't think I can compete with most other CS applicants when it comes to ECs so I decided to just show more personality and tried to be more funny on supps. For Princeton's personality supp, I talked about how I wanted to learn photoshop to crop my face onto an uncle sam poster and making myself 8'5 blah blah (this went viral on the a2c subreddit recently bc of how funny it was. Check my past posts in profile if you wan read). For Harvard, I talked about shitting and flushing toilets for intellectual experience and helping my neighbor raise rent for his tenants for the \"elaborate on an EC\" supp. For Cornell, I wrote about picking underwear for girls (specifcally my little sister) for community essay. Rest assured, I worded all my supps well. I just wanted to write about unique topics to stand out more, even if it's interpreted badly by AOs. I'm honestly willing to take taht gamble cuz afterall, ivies and a lot of t20s are all crapshoots)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* UMich LSA EA (Data Sci + Creative Writing, OOS)\n* UIUC EA (Data Sci + Info Sci, OOS)\n\nDeferrals/Waitlists:\n\n* Stony Brook EA (Computer Sci) <- This was my safety too LMFAOO\n\nRejections:\n\n* UPenn ED (Comp Sci)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Info**\n\nI listed some extenuating circumstances on my common app. In my junior year, my family duties spiked up a shit ton because my father opened a restaurant in Manhattan and often stayed overnight at there. So, I became in charge of taking my little sister to her extracurricular classes around the city after school 3-4 times a week. I would often have to get home after my school and ECs, make dinner, and take her to her classes. By the time I got home each day, it would already be 9-10PM. On top of that, the train commute back and forth from school each day is about 2.5 hours. Junior year grades dropped a fair bit as a result.\n\nAs for college results, I was kinda shocked about UIUC. I decided to apply like an hour before the deadline and wrote my supps in like 30 mins lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also added some awards from PSAL and NHS in additional info too"

(which doesn't affect admission to the UCS or CSUS)\n\n**Residence**: Central California\n\n**GPA**: 4.76w, 3.96uw, 4.23(CSU)\n\n**Coursework:** Most rigorous courses offered at my school. However, didn't take any computer science classes, and the highest level of math provided was **MATH AI SL**.\n\n**IB Scores**:\n\n5 in Spanish B SL (that's it..)\n\n**Awards**:\n\nHonor Roll (yup, that's the only award i listed)\n\n**Extracurriculars:**\n\n1. Coding Club, President - Mentor 25 students regarding programming projects in Python, HTML, Javascript, and Scratch\n2. MESA Club, Vice-president - Competitions in the fields of math, engineering, and science achievement.  (I never won any competition here.)\n3. Event organizer of fundraiser that raised $4k+\n4. Pre-college data science summer program at a local private university (not at all prestigious)\n5. Personal Python Projects (low-level but to me, meaningful projects such as calculator app, ai chatbot, Python blog, etc.)\n6. Chess Club, Treasurer\n7. Python Udemy Course Certificate\n\n**Essays**: 7-10/10? I don't really know how to rate them. Any rating I give is most likely innaccurate\n\n**Additional Info Section:**  \nMy high school did not offer any Physics or Computer Science IB classes. If given the opportunity, I would have definitely taken them as they align with my aspirations in life.\n\n**Schools:**\n\nSJSU: Accepted\n\nUC Berkeley: **Accepted, EARLY ADMISSION TOO!!!** (most likely going to commit lol)\n\n(no decisions have been released for the rest)\n\nUCLA\n\nUCD\n\nUCSD\n\nStanford\n\n**NOTES:**\n\nI'm extremely happy that I was accepted into Berkeley, especially as one of their early admits, of which only \\~2000/124000 applicants were selected! Prior to this, the chanceme subreddit had degraded my hopes of getting into a good college. I've heard the horror stories of Asian guys applying for CS getting rejected, yet these are the same people who win international coding competitions, start non-profits, create genuinely intuitive software, and more. At most, I was only the president of a club, so if these people couldn't get in, why would I? I honestly don't know why Berkeley chose me over these people. However, I have a large suspicion that it was my essays and the way that I conveyed my story through them that resulted in Berkeley liking me. I really honed in on the fact that CS and any other technological classes were basically non-existent in my high school, and how I was the  \"catalyst\" that helped immerse them with the clubs I was involved with. I guess my advice for anyone working on their college apps is to make sure you emphasize the impact you had on your community regardless of the scale. Colleges want to see that you are willing to take the initiative, which they are hoping you will also apply to their campus.\n\nedit: thank you all for the congratulations, you've all made my weekend better :) "

I can't exactly rate because I haven't read but hoping (9/10)\n\n**LOR 2:** Human Geo teacher, always said good things about me in parent teacher conferences, recommended me for an internship and wrote a very heartfelt letter, again hard to estimate when I haven't read but hopefully (8.5/10)\n\n**LOR 3:** Campaign Manager - i think it would be very sweet, talk about how hardworking and passionate I am but not a one-in-a-million rec letter yk, i'd guess (7/10)\n\n**Interviews**\n\nOnly had georgetown but was a 10/10 in my opinon! I'm a d1 yapper (hence half my awards being debate/public speaking awards) so speaking to people is where i truly shine. Basically i was assigned an interview but he didn't respond for like a month so i reached out to the regional alumni interview chair, and then two months later i finally got an interview slotted but i don't think there were any other interviewers available so the STATE CHAIR ended up interviewing me himself!! he said that in all his years interviewing, he has never seen anyone as passionate as me, that i was the absolute perfect fit for georgetown, and he clearly said that he would write me a great recommendation. half way through the interview he lowk stopped asking me questions and it almost felt like he started convincing ME to attend georgetown instead of me convicing him that i was a good fit for georgetown. After the interview i lowk got emotional bc it was such a good conversation, and i wish i had more interviews for schools because while some of my \"hard\" factors and stats might not be as outstanding, it's my personality and passion that i think truly shine. unfortunate that the one interview i had was at the school i probably have the lowest chances at since it's full test history required, and my testing history sucks.\n\n**Essays**\n\n**7/10 Common App Essay:** I think idea was great, execution may have fell short. Alot of people who have read it, including 2 english teachers and 2 counselors, have loved it and gave me no feedback on it telling me not to change a thing. but on the other hand it was harshly critiqued by some current college students. re-reading it i feel like i could've done a better job, and maybe i'm a little disappointed but i might be too hard on myself after being influenced by others opinions. the one thing i'm certain about tho is its attention-grabbing, funny, and unconventional.\n\n**Supplements:** Varied by school but i think mostly 8/10 or even dare i say 9/10.  i loved alot of my RD supplements, my EA supplements were good but i think i really got the hang of writing  by RD time. UC PIQs were baddd tho bc they were rushed.\n\n**DecisionsAcceptances:**\n\n* Pitt w/ guaranteed law school + deans law scholarship of 20k/year (rolling)\n* Fordham w/ merit scholarship of 29k/year (EA)\n* Indiana w/ kelley direct admit + dean's scholarship of 8k/year (EA)\n* Umiami w/ president\u2019s scholarship of 25k/year (EA)\n* Northeastern (boston campus!!) (EA)\n* Rutgers (arts and sciences for poli sci & business school - surprised abt buisness bc my sat is lowk a bit low for buisness especially with how competitive it is this year + i literally ranked buisness my 2nd choice bc i didn't think id get it LOL) (RD)\n\n**Deferrals**:Cornell ED (at least it wasn't a rejection, a win is a win)\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\nUNC Chapel Hill (EA-OOS) SO SUPRISED i thought i'd be straight up rejected, chances of getting off the waitlist are like next to none but again a win is a win and hopefully this means i'm competitive for other schools of this caliber\n\n**Rejections**\n\nTulane (EA) not even a deferral \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94 this was one of my first decisions after cornell and i thought i was cooked at every other school on my list bc i wasn't even deferred, but i'm feeling much more optimistic now.\n\n**Waiting:**\n\n* Vanderbilt ED2\n* GWU\n* American\n* Syracuse\n* Barnard\n* Dartmouth\n* Cornell (RD after deferral)\n* Umich\n* NYU\n* Northwestern\n* UC Berkley\n* UCLA\n* UCSB\n* UCSD\n* UC Davis\n* BU\n* Georgetown\n* USC\n* UVA\n\nAny predictions for the rest of my decisions? I feel like my current decisions indicate i should at least be competitive/not an auto-reject \ud83e\udd1e I'm PRAYING for at least one top school or good merit at any school! also odds may be stacked against me for vandy ed2 but i am holding on to my hope & manifesting!! good luck for anyone else going through this process, admissions are brutal, applying to so many schools is especially brutal but we've made it through the worst part and the best part is yet to come!\n\nin the wise words of SZA in her song Normal Girl, THIS TIME NEXT YEAR WE'LL BE LIVING SO GOOD WON'T REMEMBER NO PAINNN I SWEARRRR  \ud83e\udd73 \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73"

Was it stupid to apply there ED: absolutely. However, I do believe that through that mistake, I was able to discover what I actually desire from my higher learning, a result which I am glad to have discovered!\n\nAlso thought it would be fun to share that following my acceptance to UMich I got an email from my admissions officer sharing her content for my acceptance and congratulating my application \u2013 honestly needed that XD.\n\nRight now, I am just waiting for RD's responses, but I have learned I must be patient, and hopefully, all works out well\u2013 praying for Duke!"

My research project was also published on my mentors website.\n\nEssays/LORS:\n\nI wrote a couple of essays my first essay was relating my passion for science to the death of my aunt who was like a second mom to me. My second essay was all over the place I talked about why I want to be a physicians assistant over other medical careers and how my aunts death drove my passion for medicine(she was shot so as a PA I will be able to save the lives of many in her honor). I also talked about some of my unrelated interests like cancer biology,crime shows and cooking. \n\nI got three letters of recommendation. One came from my counselor. One came from my anatomy and physiology teacher. The last one came from my mentor. I feel like the best one was probably my mentors since during my research she learned a lot about me and she also has a literal PhD in Microbiology which probably helped a lot since it relates the most to my major. My second best was probably my anatomy teacher since she always says I come up with the most creative projects in her class. My counselors was probably pretty basic.\n\nAccepted:Georgia Southern(Biochem),Georgia State(Forensic Chemistry),Augusta University(Molecular Biology),Coastal College of Georgia(Biology)\n\nDenied:John Jay College of Criminal Justice(Forensic Toxicology),LeMoyne College(Biochemistry),Mercer University(Molecular Biology),Kennesaw(Biochemistry),Savannah State(Forensic Science)\n\nStill waiting on:Albany State(Forensic Science),Valdosta State(Chemistry,and Charles R Drew University(Biomedical Science).\n\nEven though Augusta was my dream school I decided that I will be attending Georgia Southern instead. I\u2019m honestly still shocked that I was even accepted to any schools when I started the college application process in the Fall I was considering just going to community college and transferring because I felt that no 4 year school would accept me. I expected to get rejected by majority of the schools I applied too but all that matters is the schools that accepted me. My first couple years of Highschool were pretty rough mentally for me I had a 1.5 after my sophomore year of high school. My senior year I really focused on grades though and I was able to obtain a 4.0 average for the fall semester and I plan to do the same thing again for the spring semester. I do believe my research experience did help a lot especially since my mentor is a microbiology professor. Like I said on my last post I have heard it all people literally bullied me in school telling me I\u2019m too stupid to be a physicians assistant but ignoring them is what helped me improve and personally I\u2019m proud of how much I have improved. I mean I went from smoking weed and skipping school to getting a 4.0 and being accepted into a pretty good four year who wouldn\u2019t be proud of that."

For reference to those unaware, you need to have a nomination, so some of my application was sent to my local nomination committee. I will specify if that was the case. You also need a fitness test, I put my score below. \n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: F\n\n* Race/Ethnicity: White, not Hispanic\n\n* Residence: America\n\n* Income Bracket: 500,000+\n\n* Type of School: Competitive public HS\n\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): N/a\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: Engineering of some sort, did not apply as that however. \n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.6 as of second semester senior year, but the college I applied to doesn\u2019t look at senior grades full stop so 3.7. Weight 4.2/4.0\n\n* Rank (or percentile): N/a\n\n* \\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 10 APs, including senior year \n\n* Senior Year Course Load: Physics, gov, Spanish, calculus BC, Lit, all AP. \n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\n* SAT I: 1520 (770RW, 750M)\n\n* AP/IB: 3 5s, 2 4s \n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n1. Civil Air Patrol - Cadet Commander as highest position earned. Basically AFJROTC without the class requirement. \n\n2. Varsity track athlete for 2 years, XC one year. \n\n3. Tutored Ukrainians in English. \n\n4. Online tutoring for American kids. \n\n5. Private Pilot\u2019s License - 120 hours w/ license, however did not apply with the license as it wasn\u2019t done yet. \n\n6. Job experience during the school year and summer. \n\nI think that\u2019s all I put. \n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. VFW Award, local. (Veterans of foreign wars.) \n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCAP Squadron Commander / Ex service member: 10/10. Read it myself. This one went to both the nomination committee at my district and the school itself.\n\nPhysics Teacher: 7/10. I read this one, very mid. Went to nomination committee iirc. \n\nPrecalc teacher: 8/10. I was always very kind to her and she enjoyed having me despite my occasional lack of discipline. Also got to read this one. This went went to the school itself. \n\nAP Lang teacher: did not read this one, can\u2019t really rate it. However he told me he never writes negative things and we knew each other well. More than that he was very supportive of me going down this route. Went to the school. \n\nCounselor recommendation: basically wrote this one myself, she just reworded it. 10/10 if I do say so myself. /s. Tbh this was also pretty mid, she just highlighted my accomplishments. \n\nAPUSH teacher: 11/10. Holy hell she was so nice to me, she thought I was funny so that helped a lot. I got to read this one too. This one went to the school. \n\nFlight instructor: 6/10. We didn\u2019t like each other, I ended up switching instructors. Lol. Just a generic letter overall. Went to the committee. \n\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI had two interviews for the one school I applied to. One was for the actual school, one was for the nomination to the school. \n\nNomination interview: had some major fumbles. It was in front of a group of graduates to all the different service academies, which made me nervous. But honestly, a lot better than I could have anticipated, when I finished one of the board members came out to talk to me and told me that I did well. \n\nSchool interview: awful. It was online and they kind of just wanted you to regurgitate all the good stuff you\u2019d done. Not much of an interview. My answers were not particularly good either. \n\n\n**Essays**\n\nI wrote four essays in the end, two used for both the school and nomination committee, and two separate ones used for the school and nomination committee. \n\nEssay #1: A story of how I resisted the urge to cheat in AP World. Used for both nomination committee and the school. It was indirectly about the honor code at USAFA, but didn\u2019t state that explicitly. I knew my audience. \n\nEssay #2: Used for both. A reflection on my experiences tutoring Ukrainians and how it fueled my urge to serve America. I\u2019m going to go ahead and give this a 10/10 because a committee member told me it was the best essay he\u2019d received. \n\nEssay #3: A quick reflection on what made me unique. Wrote about my respect tradition yet ability to think outside the box. Mid. Only used this for the school. \n\nEssay #4: An hundred word \u201cessay\u201d about what made me likely to succeed at a service academy. I wrote about how challenges fuel me on. Again, I wrote for my audience, and for such a short bit, it came out pretty well. \n\n*CFA - Fitness assessment*\nVery mid. I talked to my admissions mentor and he said I barely passed. \n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n1: United States Air Force Academy \n\n*Rejections:*\n\nN/a \n\n*Additional info*: \n\nSo, if you\u2019re in my shoes right now or will be come senior year, I want to first tell you to not do what I did and apply to only one school. Especially when that one school has the world\u2019s most complicated admissions system, a 6% acceptance rate, and standards you mostly don\u2019t meet. That being said, I decided to do this because I was betting that my district would have limited applicants for nominations, and they are basically required to let you in if you are the only kid with a nom in your district. Last year in my district, only one person applied for a nomination to USAFA and so she immediately got in. I wanted that to be me. \n\nSpoiler alert: I wasn\u2019t the only one. Oops. When I realized my mistake, I started planning for CC. Luckily the nomination board really liked me and the other applicants were not the most competitive. Thank god \ud83d\ude4f."

        "post": "Hey, i already posted on chance me (stupid of me to do tbh) but wanted to update yall on my results\n\nHere is a repost of my application:\n\nDemographics: White male, senior. my school is ranked the best public high school in our state; we are not magnet or charter. quite small, there are 200ish kids in my class.\n\nMajor: i applied mostly econ, some data science and quantitative economics\n\nACT: 35 superscore (35 on each section), 34 not superscored \n\nSAT: only took once, 1510: 770 Math, 740 Reading/ English. Submitted both ACT and SAT to all schools except no SAT to Duke.\n\nGPA: 4.46/4.0 Weighted. We do not have class rank or unweighted GPAs. AP courses are weighted 5.0, honors 4.5. (some schools have APs as 5.5, for context) All As and A minuses.\n\nI believe I am at the 10% mark for my grade (very competitive school, to give myself some credit)\n\nAPs: APUSH (5), Lang (5), Environmental Science (4), Calc BC (4), Gov (5); Currently taking: Stats, Spanish, Psych. Also taking Multivariable Calculus with dual enrollment and an online english class through Dual Enrollment. Besides APs I took mostly honors classes besides a few like health and chemistry.\n\nI live in a fairly affluent neighborhood, as well.\n\nECs: \n\n- President of my schools Key club, and on the board for 2 years prior. It is possibly the largest club at my school, there are about 60 consistent members. We do fundraisers and a lot of service around my school. It is a large commitment for me. (3hrs/ 40 weeks)\n\n- Sleepaway Camp Counselor for 8 weeks this summer. Full time job for sure. I had 10 8 year old boys and my camp was very understaffed. (98hrs/8weeks)\n\n-Wrote for my schools Newspaper junior year and now am an editor of one of the sections. We are a very established student newspaper in my state. \n(5 hours/40 weeks)\n\n- Work as a host and Carry Out host at a local restaurant. about 15 hours a week. (15 hours/50 weeks)\n\n- 4 years of school tennis. I play 6 hours per week during the offseason as well. \n\n-Math resource center tutor at my school every day for Junior and Senior year. (5hours/ 40 weeks)\n\n- Started a club called \u201cDestress for success club\u201d junior year and am the president. We did yoga, coloring, etc.\n(1 hour/ 10 weeks)\n\n- Member of local service corporation where we went to food banks, worked with habitat for humanity, worked at furniture banks, etc. (4 hours/ 10 weeks)\n\n- Student council: I am a project manager fir a couple events this year, but only joined student council last year. Once a week. (1 hour/ 40 weeks)\n\n-Friendship Circle: Organization that works with Kids with special needs. I have a buddy who I text and call often and they host fun events for all the kids which I attend. (2 hours/ 10 weeks)\n\n- Two youth philanthropic organizations which I unfortunately did not have room for in my common app, but mentioned in a couple of supplementals.\n\nAwards: not many; Seal of Spanish Biliteracy, National Honors Society, Ap scholar with distinction\n\nEssay: I would say my essay is a strong 8.5/10\n\nOk, here are my results for early action:\nAccepted: \nOhio State (3k a year + honors)\nPitt (+ guaranteed grad school)\nMaryland (+ honors) \nWisconsin-Madison\nPenn State\nIllinois Urbana-Champagne\n\nDeferred: \nMichigan\nTulane\n(both hurt \ud83d\ude1e)\n\nRejected:\nUNC Chapel Hill (as suspected)\nUVA\n\nRemaining (mostly super-reaches lmao):\nPenn\nYale\nPrinceton\nDartmouth\nDuke\nNorthwestern\nVanderbilt\nMichigan \nTulane\n\nI am getting nervous, because all that I have left is super reaches! I feel thankful to have already gotten into such amazing schools such as Wisconsin and UIUC, and am perfectly content attending those schools! I have already realized that my chances are slim to none at each school, but I might as well be optimistic!! \n\nIt feels sucky to get denied anywhere, but I am just trying to keep my head up and enjoy my senior year. But, sometimes it\u2019s hard to keep off my mind. I feel as though that if you are smart and hard working enough, you can be successful no matter where you attend school. This said, I still really like my reach schools, they are all amazing.\n\nCurrent prediction: 0 of my remaining schools come through. College admissions is a crapshoot, and all I can do now is cross my fingers and wait."

Readers can tell if you really care about what you dedicate your time towards doing.\n\nALSO! Don't tunnel vision on getting into a good college. I led a very active social life and didn't care too much about school and ended up okay; don't let 4 years of suffering be justified by a college acceptance letter! Our childhood is invaluable and we will never get to be kids like this again, so don't waste it!"

I started in the beginning of last year and didn't have a good essay till close to the deadlines. I think i did pretty well on the short essays as I worked on most before school started but I rushed on some schools since I decided to do EA instead of RD.\n\nI wrote my essay on how my eyesight is deteriorating very fast and how it made it very hard for me to learn during the transition from middle school to high school because I would get tired fast or cause severe headaches to the point I struggled with sleep and couldn't focus in class.  I wrote my essay about how it affected me socially and physically and how I learned to live with it. And how my goals emerged from it.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAcceptances: ALL EA except Colorado School of mines, iowa state and  University of Arizona which was rolling\n\nRPI\n\nUmass amherst\n\nWPI\n\nDrexel\n\nColorado school of mines\n\nUniversity of Arizona\n\nRose Hulman\n\nIllinois Tech\n\nRutgers new brunswick\n\nMichigan Tech\n\nIowa State\n\nOhio State Main campus\n\nUniversity of Maryland College Park\n\nRejections:\n\nCase Western\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nwaiting:\n\nvirginia tech\n\ncornell\n\nlehigh\n\nRIT\n\nTAMU\n\nUT Austin\n\nUIUC\n\ngeorge mason\n\nVirginia tech\n\nU-wisconsin madison\n\nNotre dame\n\nAdditional Information:My eyes make it hard for me to focus on things sometimes out of nowhere I'll see double or everything starts to blur a little bit. Afterwards ill had a severe headache, i began working to save some money for a surgery and for college funds.\n\nDuring sophomore year my grades in algebra and AP psychology took a big hit as I had to deal with the death of a close family member. I missed the midterms for both classes because of time zone differences and delayed flights and when I got back was so behind that i barely passed AP psych and barely kept a B for honors Algebra.\n\nAnd regarding not taking AP Calc, I was in the class 2 weeks before school started but, then somehow they deleted everyone's schedules and had to randomize it so I was no longer in it. Tried to fix it, but it never worked out.\n\nReflections:Despite having my essays planned out, i wish i looked into the scholarship deadlines for some schools because i didn't realize there were additional submissions due by Nov 1st and not later down the road."

You never know what will happen and this proves that grades aren\u2019t everything, anything can happen. I just got lazy and demotivated throughout high school but I got lucky in the end.

They only asked me like 2 questions and we spent most of the time talking about our dogs and how cold it was in Boston. No idea if that bodes well for my application but fortunately interviews don't matter very much.\n\n**Essays**\n\nLooking back I think most of my EA essays were not great. They didn't say much about my personality/what I value and many of the supplements were pretty generic.\n\nI think that my RD essays (even thought I wrote all of them over winter break lol) are honestly way better, since I had a much clearer view of what I wanted to do in college and what I was interested in. I talked a lot about psychology, philosophy, how I'm interested in the ethics of engineering, etc., and I think I had a pretty good \"community\" essay. Hopefully that will resonate with some of the colleges I applied to for RD.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* UMD\n* UT Dallas\n* UNC\n* UMass\n* Purdue\n* NC State\n\n**Deferrals:**\n\n* UMich\n* USC\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n* Penn (ED)\n* Georgia Tech\n* UIUC\n\n**Awaiting:**\n\n* Brown\n* Emory\n* Vanderbilt\n* CMU\n* WashU\n* Northwestern\n* Cornell\n* UChicago (ED2)\n* MIT\n* Harvey Mudd\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nAlthough my EA apps were honestly not great, I think it went pretty well. I'm a bit disappointed to be flat-out rejected from GT and UIUC but not super surprised considering how competitive those schools are for CS.\n\nHopefully better essays + a reformatted EC list on my Common App will give me a decent chance at some of my RD schools (or god forbid UChicago ED2), but I'm not extremely confident. Either way I think I would be happy going to Purdue or UNC.\n\nAny advice/thoughts/predictions would be great, and I really appreciate all the discussion on my last post. Good luck to everyone!\n\n**edit: can I just say I hate the goddamn reddit post editor with a passion. it's so terrible and does the most random shit for no reason**"

Without doxxing myself, my family's AGI puts us a few thousand dollars above the poverty line for our family size, but with disability income we're lower middle class. To answer in the same way I did for the U of M income question on the common app: 50K-75K.\n\nType of School: Regular HS, but with an early college program that I'm participating in.\n\nHooks: Theater, Model UN, overcoming income related adversity, grade 13 Early College student.\n\nIntended Major(s): History\n\n**Academics**\n\nGPA (UW/W): 3.7UW/3.889W\n\nRank (or percentile): N/A, HS early college doesn't have it.\n\n\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 4 APs, 14 Dual Enrolled Classes (4 during traditional HS, 10 taken my 5th year).\n\nSenior Year Course Load: 10 Dual enrolled CC classes because I wanted that stuff PAID FOR. 18 credits first semester, 17 credits the second.\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\nList the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.\n\nSAT: 1350 (740 RW, 610 M)\n\nAP/IB: AP Stats (5), AP Psych (4), AP Lang (3), APUSH (3)\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\nList all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.\n\n\\#1 HS Theater: 4 years, Actor all four and VP for one.

I'm going to assume the college LORs were similar. No ratings out of 10 though because that's dumb.\n\nCC English Professor: Took two classes with him. Unironic saint, like he just gave me the books for my second class with him because he'd heard me discussing my family situation with a friend in his first class. Was very engaged in his class so he has academic material to write about. Wrote a fantastic LOR when I was applying for tutoring, confident he was great here too.\n\nHS Theater Director/ Drama Teacher: She probably knows me best out of any of my recommenders, and knew me for the longest too. Acted for four years and took lots of her drama classes, knew me fairly well as a person, wrote an amazing scholarship LOR that focused more on me as a person than my academics (though she gave those a very good review too), I'm sure the college LOR was similar.\n\nMUN Coach/ Debate Teacher: Liked me a lot and knew my academic abilities fairly well, if slightly less on both counts than the previous two recommenders. Main thing with her is that she historically has procrastinated on LORs a ton (both this time and with a previous scholarship one). The actual material in the scholarship one was good though so no complaints.\n\n**Essays**\n\nWrote it about winning my HMUN award, as well as how I overcame adversity and class barriers to get it (lots of New England trust fund prep kids at HMUN). While waiting for decisions I alternated between thinking it's the best thing I've ever written to the single worst thing ever, but looking backwards it seems to have been enough.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\nNote: All colleges applied to EA (or on an EA timeframe at least, some had rolling admissions so not technically EA)\n\nAcceptances:\n\nMichigan State University (no scholarships or aid smh smh)\n\nCentral Michigan University ($5K/year scholarship)\n\nWestern Michigan University (Honors College, $4K/year scholarship)\n\nEastern Michigan University (Honors College, $8k/year scholarship to be replaced by free tuition once FAFSA rolls in)\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN - ANN ARBOR (should qualify for free tuition through goblue guarantee once FAFSA rolls in)\n\nWaitlists:\n\nNOTHING HAHAHAHAHA\n\nRejections:\n\nNOT A SINGLE ONE LET'S FREAKING GOOO\n\nReflections:\n\nI know the type of person who browses these A2C-related forums, so I want to say that obviously my circumstances aren't exactly the same as anyone else's, obviously I wasn't applying for the ivy league, obviously being in-state helped with getting into UMich, and obviously I did have some impressive stuff on my application which helped a lot too. But I didn't really stress about college admissions until I was in the middle of doing my common app, I just lived my life and tried my best and took the opportunities that were available to me and that I was interested in. Weirdly enough that might have even been a good 'strategy', since I don't think I would have done as well in theater and MUN if they had just been ECs I was doing for the sake of looking good. When I look back on the past five years I'm happy for what they were to me then, as well as what they've helped me achieve now. All that to say: if you're some HS junior worrying about applying to UMich three years from now, please don't let college anxieties get in the way of you living a fun life. It's important, yes, but your life now is important too. Anyways, happy college applications y'all and HELL YEAH I GOT INTO U OF M LET'S FREAKING GOOOOOOOOO."

To start this off I have a 1.97 GPA and I am posting this for Inspiration to anyone who may be in the same situation. I struggled mentally a lot my first couple of years of Highschool. I even went through a point where I was doing drugs and skipping school. My senior year I have been doing a lot better and have been able to obtain a 4.0 average in all classes. I think what changed is me actually doing the school work and obviously I also got some psychological help which also did help with my academics. I also set myself some goals which helped me do a lot better in school. Also honestly school isn\u2019t that hard when you actually try.\n\nDemographics: I\u2019m a Male,African American,Bigger Town in Western Georgia,No Hooks. 2nd best Highschool out of 9 public high schools in my district.\n\nAcademics: 1.97 GPA,2 Honors and 1 AP by time I graduate. The only advanced classes for my senior year are Honors Chemistry,Honors Anatomy and Physiology,and AP Government.\n\nStandardized Testing: to be honest I have no idea it wasn\u2019t good I think I got around a 1080 on the SAT (I didn\u2019t study) but it was the score I used for my applications \n\nExtracurriculars: full time job during senior year( a lot of my classes are online which allows me to work a lot more),mentored forensic microbiology research project(did a review paper over current research),did marching band and symphonic band for 3 years,I also cook for friends and family on the side(cooking is my second passion)\n\nIntended major:I already know I\u2019m gonna get hate for this I am smart I just didn\u2019t apply myself my first couple of years of Highschool but most of my majors are biochemistry,biology or molecular biology on a pre-physician Assistant track. You can tell me I\u2019m too stupid to be a PA or anything you won\u2019t I honestly don\u2019t care I\u2019ve heard it all already.\n\nAwards:My review paper was actually published on my mentors website I linked all of that on my application though. When I was in band I earned an award for being in honors band.\n\nEssays/LORs/Interviews: My essay was all over the place but I related my passion for medicine/healthcare to my own mental health and my aunts death(she was shot). I would read it back over to see what else I talked about but I\u2019m not in the mood to cry honestly. My forensic microbiology mentor was a professor and she wrote me a LOR. My counselor wrote me a LOR. My Honors Anatomy and Physiology teacher wrote me a LOR and I think that\u2019s it. I also wrote a second essay talking more about why I want to be a physician assistant over a physician or nurse practitioner and I related my passion to be a physician assistant to some of my more strange interests (for some reason cancer biology and forensic science are really fascinating topics to me so I talked about that).\n\nDecisions:so far I have been accepted to two colleges those being Georgia Southern for Biochemistry and College of Coastal Georgia For Biology. I have been rejected from LeMoyne College for Biochemistry and John Jay College for Forensic Toxicology. I have been waitlisted by Augusta University for Molecular Biology. I applied to a load of other schools however that I am still waiting for decisions from or schools that are waiting on my final transcript."

She's an amazing teacher, really likes me, and has told me numerous times how proud she is of all the work I've done since coming to Y.

I needed a STEM teacher, I'd only had her for 2 months or so when I asked for the letter. She's very nice although we don't know each other that well but I gave her some good things to write about. She also told me I'm one of 2 students that asked her for a letter so that could either be very good or very bad.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement- if anything gets me in, I guess it'll be this. I thought it was alright, but the counselor asked to read my first draft in front of the class anonymously and a couple kids started TEARING UP?? And he told me he was choked up reading it as well. Cross my heart. Problem is, after that I had to cut it down from 1100 words (whoops) to 650 and I didn't get much feedback on it afterward, so I can only hope I didn't leave whatever it was people liked on the cutting room floor.\n\nIt was about how I felt transferring to a fancy private school while working at my neighborhood grocery store where most people who worked there were high school dropouts that encouraged me to go to college, but eventually I figured out me and the private school kids weren't so different, please let me into your fancy college I promise I can be trusted around the 1% and their progeny and will not try to Talented Mr Ripley them, etc. etc. (Come to think about it, the anonymous reading doesn't make a whole lot of sense since I was one of 3 new kids that year, and the only one who was emo about it. Everyone figured it out immediately.)\n\nMy statements were fine, although I kind of threw the Chicago ones because I doubted I'd get in (don't do this), as well as the Rochester ones because I realized I didn't even know if I wanted to go there.\n\n**Decisions** (I'm a little insecure about how small my list is but I already got into 1 school I like, and that's all that matters)\n\n**Acceptances**:\n\nMacalester EA\n\nFordham EA\n\nUNM\n\nBinghamton EA\n\n**Deferrals**:\n\nCornell ED\n\nUChicago EA\n\n**We'll see**:\n\nNortheastern EDII\n\nNorthwestern RD\n\nYale RD (lol)\n\nU of Rochester RD\n\n**Additional information:**\n\nI used this section to trash X a little, but it's true. I never wanted to go there in the first place. We couldn't pick our classes and everyone in the grade went to them together. They were ridiculously easy and real boring so my grades slipped significantly. I had to get special permission to take math classes at community college since the highest math class they had there was trig which I took in 8th grade. I got the C in 9th grade because I didn't understand online college interfaces and was too shy to ask, but I got over it (and the next year I pulled an A in college stats). I didn't bring up the other C because it was in 9th grade 2020 zoom PE and I was 13. I doubt any AO cares. I'm trying to get my hands on X's school profile currently as it should help me out a little since the average GPA there can't have been more than 3.3."

These experiences, ranging from airport work stories to cultural insights during travels, shaping my desire to explore the world further through aviation and encounters with diverse cultures. \n\nFor the Uncommon/Quirky UChicago Essay, I wrote in the form of a sailor's log journal as they fall off the edge of the Earth into the hollow Earth, and the experiences they face. (The 1300s sailor prompt. I think this essay was REALLY ballsy to put into my application, but why not I guess.)\n\nFor my Why UChicago essay, I wrote about how watching my mom as a home health nurse care for her patients, comforting them through a shared culture, made me want to pursue specific UChicago study abroad programs, learning more about foreign cultures. I also wrote about a community health fellowship program and how my passion for public service would tie into my participation in the program. I ended off my essay with imagery about the university's tradition of midnight soccer.  \n\n\nI topped off my application with a video showing my interests, experiences, and travels. I think I did well on it.   \n\n\n*Temple University (RD)* \\- **Accepted, Founder's Scholarship**\n\n*Johns Hopkins (RD)*   \nReused the Why UChicago essay beginning about cultures/study abroad. Should've probably put more work into it though. \n\n*NYU (RD)*\n\nWrote about a quote from Ronaldo (the Portuguese one), explaining how I'd utilize a similar work ethic at NYU. \n\n*Case Western Reserve University (RD)*\n\n*Northwestern University (RD)*  \nWrote about study abroad, yet again, what I'd paint on the rock (an Ethiopian flag), and as for location, I talked about how I could have the experiences of someone far from home, but still be comforted by certain aspects of Evanston.\n\n*Colgate University (RD)*\n\n*Amherst College (RD)*\n\nWrote about my volunteering experiences in Ethiopia, discussing how community service relates to leadership qualities and what benefits can come from those experiences.   \n\n\nOther than those privates, I applied to UCLA, Berkeley, UCSD, UC Irvine, UC Davis, UC Riverside, Cal Poly SLO, Cal Poly Pomona, San Diego State University, and CSU Long Beach.   \n\n\n**Conclusions:**  \nI didn't do myself any favors with my grades and my T/O status, but I've tried to write about my interests instead of pretending to like things I don't. Hopefully I'll see more good news as time passes, but things look bleak. Please don't hesitate to let me know your thoughts about my odds for my selected colleges. "

Rewarded for top performance.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nVery mid tbh but good enough I think?\n\n\\#1: National Hispanic Recognition Award\n\n\\#2: National Rural and Small Town Recognition Award\n\n\\#3: John and Abigail Adams Scholarship Recipient (State)\n\n\\#4: AP Scholar with Honor\n\n\\#5: Academic Award: Honors Physics (School)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nWasn't very close to any of my teachers but they still liked me enough to write good LORs.\n\nCalc Teacher (9/10): Most Passionate/Strongest teacher ever who watched me grow from literally crying in front of her in Calc BC & almost failing midterm->A in AP Stats plus 5 on exam even though she was gone for surgery->this year chilling in multivariable calc and using extra time to fully-master Calc II to retake BC exam and get 5.\n\nPsych Teacher (7/10): Apparently I'm the only student she ever had get a 5 on AP Psych exam? We got along well and she said she thinks I'm intelligent, she knows about my diverse background, and I've asked her for LORs before for scholarships. She said my LOR was very good but she wrote it quickly.\n\nCounselor (6/10): She didn't know me well but I asked her to explain all the discrepancies in my app (C in Online Chem, few Bs, scheduling issues for classes like regular Honors Chem, AP Physics C, and AP Lit). Hopefully this allows my academic prowess to be seen clearly by AdComs instead of covered by mistakes and lack of APs.\n\nMy app would've been much better if I got an LOR from the professor I worked with for ant research but tbh he didn't know me that well so idk what he would've written anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interviews**\n\nBoth had very little prep (did <15 min of research for MIT intereview). So both interview had some mediocre answers and some stumbles, but nothing major.\n\nDartmouth (7/10) (\\~1hr): She was impressed by my ants and when I mentioned first-year-trips. I think she could see that I was genuinely interested, especially with DOC (outing club). But this was my first ever interview so I think some of my answers were a bit BS & possibly less compelling/believable.\n\nMIT (7/10) (\\~1hr): Honestly felt somewhat similar to first interview. She seemed to like my ants and told me she could tell I was truly passionate which she claimed was rare nowadays. But she also said not to get caught up w/ admissions bc MIT is super competitive and the AOs look at national awards first (but she said she tells everyone this\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f). I stumbled a bit at the beginning (maybe bc she wasn\u2019t super direct and it was over zoom) and had to think way too long when she asked which adjectives describe me \ud83d\udc80. Overall went well though \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nBrown Video Introduction (6/10): Was super late so idk if it helped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays (Reflect on quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)**\n\nEarly-Action Personal-Statement (EA-PS) was written quickly with my friend editing, not great... (4.5/10) since it was unique and about my interest in ants but def not very genuine. Regular-Decision Personal Statement (RD-PS) was much more genuine to my interest in ants and had better insight (8/10).\n\nAll of my supplementals were a little rushed, some like Columbia and JHU I started earlier though. My first essays (Columbia & Harvard) were not great bc of this but I got much better so my later ones were written better and more quickly (I did Caltech supps in 10 hours... \ud83d\udc80).\n\nCornell Why Us was very good imo bc they have the best ant-lab in the US so I said I'd double major in Bio and Entomology and do research under Dr. Moreau (she was mentored by my hero E. O. Wilson!). Considering I applied to Cornell CALS, I feel like I have a great shot! The only thing is CALS is test-blind and I have 1550. Haha it's fine... (trust)\n\nI asked ChatGPT to Summarize these essays in a few sentences:\n\n*RD-PS:* The essay delves into the author's ant-keeping journey during quarantine, capturing the challenges and personal growth involved in maintaining colonies. The narrative highlights the author's engagement with a supportive ant-keeping community, providing valuable insights and contributing to a purpose-driven life connected to scientific research. Overall it underscores the delicate balance between passion and moderation, prompting self-reflection.\n\n*Diversity Essay* *(for several schools):* The essay explores the narrator's journey of cultural assimilation and reconnection to their Peruvian heritage. Triggered by a book detailing their family history, particularly the story of the two brother's separation, the essay emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, self-acceptance, and cultural exchange as the narrator rediscovers and shares their identity through language, cooking, and community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Awaiting**\n\nCase Western (EA-Deferred)\n\nUSC (EA-Deferred)\n\nBU (RD with EA-PS)\n\nHarvard (RD)\n\nColumbia (RD)\n\nDuke (RD)\n\nDartmouth (RD)\n\nCornell (RD)\n\nBrown (RD) \n\nUNC Chapel Hill (RD)\n\nUVA (RD)\n\nNYU (RD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nUMass Amherst (EA) - Appealed CHC decision -> admitted to Honors College (CHC) with (2k/yr)!\n\nUMass Lowell (EA)\n\nUniversity of Arizona (Rolling)\n\nUConn (RD with EA-PS) - Got UConn Award (18k/yr)!\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nJohn's Hopkins (EDII) - Yeah this sucks...\n\nCaltech (RD)\n\nNortheastern (EA-Deferred) This one is tough, I truly liked this school and submitted a LOCI (which they prob never read).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n10th: Couldn't take regular Honor Chem bc of scheduling conflict->as compromise I took Online Chem Honors, but I struggled bc it was self-paced, even tho I got As I didn't finish and got a C\n\n11th: AP Physics C  didn't run bc not enough people signed up so instead I took Honors Physics and got the highest grade!\n\n12th: Couldn't take AP Lit or AP Physics C due to scheduling issues (I had to choose AP Physics C or AP Bio, chose AP Bio bc it fit my major and much easier). I independently took a General Chem I class my my local community college to actually learn Chem and prepare for future science coursework.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other + Updates**\n\nOkay, so I kind of applied late to some of the schools to varying degrees. I explained my situation to MIT, Caltech, and Brown and got extensions to those schools and submitted mostly on time. They all downloaded my apps and everything seems to be going well so I'm hoping this will be a non-issue...\n\nWhy tf did I apply to 4 safties lol?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think there's a lot of weak points on my application but I feel like all the unique points highlighted in my title give me a pretty good chance to get into at least some top school. I mean if you think about it I'm prob the only small-town Latino ant-keeper with a 1550 stats applying to T20s! Whatever happens though I think I'll be fine with going to UMass Amherst if it's the cheapest/only option.\n\nIf I can remember I'll try to update this post as I get decisions! DM me with questions, chance me's, if you wanna read my essays, or anything else.\n\nEDIT: Updated after NEU rejection, waiting for MIT to reject me..."

(7/10) Physics teacher, pretty tight with them since he used to help out in Robotics as well, did pretty well in his class, showed a decent amount of effort, but didn't go crazy participating like some kids.\n3. (6/10) Math teacher, not too close with him, but I participated a decent amount in his class because he's a pretty interesting teacher. I did well in his class and maybe stood out? Not sure. But I've heard he writes very good recs.\n\n**Interview**\n\n*(Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\n(9/10) - Really vibed with the interviewer, who had just recently graduated.

This is what further convinced me that I wanted to pursue law.\n\n#4 Co-Editor in chief and cover artist for school English magazine for junior, senior year: I've been contributing to the newspaper since I was in 8th grade; monthly publication\n\n#5 Debate team in sophomore and junior year: I did it for fun with my friends, nothing too serious.#6 Taught middle-schoolers English at library every other weekend for sophomore, junior, and senior year\n\n-mostly filler/stuff I did for fun from here\n\n#7 Treasurer of art club for junior and senior year, member for 6 years: I've always done art as a hobby, and all I did for the position was to buy some brushes and paint (and a drawing tablet once!) and check the budget biannually.\n\n#8 Track team and cross country in sophomore and junior(specialized in 1000m); I only ran for fun, so I didn't go to the club meetings often. Top 10 in regionals so not that impressive\n\n#9 Part of Environmental Awareness club (6 years from 7th to senior); was only really there because my friends were, during lunch break every Wednesday. We made reusable paper and put up signs warning people to remember to turn the lights off in classrooms.\n\n#10 Wrote some stories for competitions and magazines: I participated in school competitions for writing, and submitted some of my writing for a magazine; I only did it maybe twice a year.\n\nAwards/HonorsList all awards and honors submitted on your application.\n\n#1 MUN awards mentioned above\n\n#2 Had a full-ride scholarship for school for \"academic excellence\" since 7th grade (first year of middle school), awarded to around 5 people per grade; maintained it for all 6 years\n\n#3 3x Annual school writing competition winner, got second place once (been participating every year since freshman)\n\n#4 Honors for high grades but I don't really know the specific criteria for that to be awarded, probably like top 25% of studentsLetters of Recommendation\n\nEnglish teacher (8/10)\n\nHad him for all 6 years. He's a great guy, and I think I got to know him pretty well through clubs. I was interested in climate change and environmental activism for about a year since I entered middle school, and I've been pretty close with him since (he loves orangutans).\n\nJapanese teacher (7/10)\n\nAnother one I've had for 6 years. He's my favorite teacher; he was also one of the supervisors for the MUN team, and I think I got to know him well through that. I'd like to think the letter was good, but what he really wanted to write might've been muddled in the actual text since it was translated into English by another teacher lmao.Interviews\n\nUPenn (8/10)\n\nI don't really have much to say except it was pretty fun talking with the interviewer. I don't think it went too badly, considering that we got carried away and talked about the most random stuff for an hour.\n\nEssays\n\nI honestly don't think all the essays I submitted were that strong (and I don't have the energy to go into them in depth). I wrote a lot about how much I love communicating, exchanging opinions, and seeing different perspectives, which stemmed from my experience overseas in kind of an extended metaphor. It was accurate since all I did during my student years was yap and argue with people...\n\nI tried to be genuine about all the stuff I wrote, but I think that might've backfired and made my essay bland and generic.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)Acceptances:UCLA!!!! (RD) attending\n\nUC San Diego (RD)\n\nNYU (RD)\n\nUSC (RD)\n\nPrinceton (RD)\n\nUC Riverside (RD)\n\nUC Santa Barbara (RD)\n\nRejections:Yale (EA) (waitlisted, then rejected) super sad about this, but I also think I wasn't good enough for it\n\nColumbia (RD)\n\nPenn (RD)\n\nCornell (RD)\n\nBrown (RD)\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nFrom last year.\n\nSome more info about my school: I come from a pretty different school (basically a normal public school in Japan except it's private) where it's near impossible to have a perfect GPA (80% of our grades are decided by tests, and the average of most classes is around 60\\~80%) and the fact that those tests are catered to students who are going to take entrance exams for super selective universities don't help.\n\nAlso, my ECs aren't that amazing compared to some others here--I saw the wasian girl with INSANE stuff like starting businesses, researching at Stanford, doing furry porn comms, etc. getting rejected from some of the schools I got into, which I didn't know could be possible, and I think my getting into UCLA and Princeton is really proof that these admissions are absolute bullshit. Good luck guys!"

I tried showcasing things that showed off my character since I knew I didn't have anything impressive. Didn't submit AP Scholar award since I had reported my AP scores and hoped my admissions officer could connect the dots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nHS Counselor: 8/10 probably. Had a really good relationship with her since Freshman year and she tells me often how she knows I'll succeed. I've had many interactions with her that I hope she was able to mention in my letter.\n\nAP English Lit/ASB Advisor: I think this letter was a 10/10. Had this teacher last year for AP Lit and my writing assignments were personal. Participated a lot in class and I think she got to know me through office hours. She's also the teacher in charge of ASB and she's seen a different side of me in a different environment. She's known to write the best letters of rec at school.\n\nPhysics Honors/Robotics: 9/10? I had him for both physics and robotics also last year. He's probably the teacher who knows the most about me because I interacted with him a lot in both a classroom and an interactive setting. He tells me what other teachers say about me lol. But I know that he genuinely thinks I will succeed in college.\n\nCollege Advisor From Outside Group: 8/10. Was able to bond with her due to being able to work with her in person many times. As a member of the program she works for, I hope she was able to mention the work I've done in that program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nRevolved around the topic of exclusion from culture due to being from a smaller Latin American country in comparison to all my classmates being Mexican; this happened when I was a kid, but I wrote about how I grew up with a specific mindset and eventually broke out (little me took it harshly, but it's okay because now I have essay writing material). A critique of different types of colorism, or at least standards of what people expect others to look like. How not feeling like enough on the outside turned to not being enough on the inside, which led to me becoming a perfectionist due to an identity crisis starting in the 1st grade. Defined my identity and passion for academics despite my past need to prove myself. I would like to think I was very bold, it's probably the best thing I've ever written.\n\nWas also very honest on my Columbia supplementals. Maybe even too honest on the one on media that advances my intellect (Attack on Titan? Really?). I think I demonstrated the activism and leadership they look for. The main thing I highlighted was my goal of seeking knowledge in all sorts of topics rather than just restricting myself into one thing.\n\nOverall I was really happy with all my essays.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n\\- >!Cal Poly Humboldt!<\n\n\\- >!Columbia University ED!< >!(with full ride due to economic status)!<\n\nApplied to a lot of other schools, (Cal States UCs, LACs, Ivies) but I withdrew from them already because I've committed to Columbia. Would be nice to know, but oh well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nIn this section, I mentioned my scheduling issues. I also mentioned another activity I participated in:\n\n\"Since my junior year, I have written and published creative writing pieces online. I have 20,000+ words written, as well as just under 5,000 counts of interactions on the website I use to publish.\"\n\nI told Columbia I write fan fiction \ud83d\udc80\n\nAnyways. I honestly don't know what it was about my application. I'm still in shock at my results. I hope this serves to help somebody out there; it is somehow possible to get into these schools without crazy activities and starting $50k non-profits. I'm the personality admit I guess? Thank you for reading this, I know it was long but I hope that I provided enough context. Once again, thank you."

In the end, I said that education was a tool for societal change, and I mentioned problems I want to fix such as those in American transit systems.\n\nNorthwestern Supplements - I wrote the main supplemental about the impact of car-centric development on my community, how I joined a Transit Council to share my thoughts, and then connected this back to Northwestern. I wrote prompt 2 (undergraduate class, research project, or creative effort) about a speech I would give, despite having a speech impediment myself.

Many colleges also have better writing resources than high schools and are willing to take a look at your application essays. This was a very shaky application\u2013poor ECs, no awards, average GPA\u2013and my essay no doubt dragged much of the rest of the app across the finish line.\n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: Male\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian\n* Residence: East Coast\n* Income Bracket: 100k-120k\n* Type of School: Competitive public school (20-25% of students to Ivies, 1500+ average SAT)\n\n**Intended Major(s):** International Affairs/Political Science\n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA/Rank (or percentile): High School 3.4/4.0, College 3.8/4.0\n* \\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 3 APs\n* Senior Year Course Load: 1 AP, 4 normal classes\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\n* SAT: 1580 (780RW, 800M)\n* ACT: 35 (36E, 34M, 35R, 35S)\n* AP: AP Spanish Language (4), AP Calc AB (5), AP Chem (5)\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities:**\n\n1. Prosecutor's office internship (over the summer, 20hrs/wk)\n2. Political canvassing (4-8hrs/wk during the school year and summer)\n3. Origami (roughly 1-4hrs/wk since I was six)\n4. School law club (low/no commitment)\n5. Robotics team (freshman year, low commitment)\n\n**Awards/Honors:** None submitted\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nHigh school economics teacher (4/10): I asked this teacher for a recommendation letter a few weeks into my first semester of senior year because I had put off doing so over the summer. He was a nice teacher, and I did fairly well in the class, but we never talked much.\n\nHigh school chemistry teacher (5/10): I took her class in 2019/2020, so I think it was hard for her to find something memorable about me as a student after nearly a year of online learning.\n\nHigh school counselor (3/10): I never put much effort into getting to know my counselor, which likely affected her LoR.\n\nCollege professor (7/10): I put in work to get to know the professor and participate regularly in class.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nGeorgetown (8/10): The interviewer was friendly and the conversation never felt abrupt or awkward. I think that we both understood that my ECs/awards looked unimpressive and I'm grateful that the interviewer allowed me to show my past/current origami projects.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App (3/10): *Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time*. My essay focused on my interest in criminal justice and the legal system, stemming from my experiences in the Prosecutor's Office and at school. The writing was poor\u2013the tone was authoritative and bordering on narcissistic\u2013and the topic was mundane.\n\nNYU, Cornell, NEU transfer (6/10): I wrote about wanting to attend a university with a more interdisciplinary approach to political science and international affairs, especially one involving math or sciences. Both of my parents are scientists, so I structured my essay around how STEM has been an integral part of my life and identity. This was a wordy and uneven essay and it was difficult to fit what I wanted to say within the character limit.\n\nGeorgetown transfer (9/10): Same topic as above, but I related my college experience to making a paper bouquet using 7/11 Slurpee straws as the stems. Very well written save for a few grammatical mistakes.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Fordham University RD\n* Stony Brook University RD\n* The George Washington University RD\n* Syracuse University RD\n* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RD\n* Georgetown University (Sophomore transfer)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* NYU (Deferred to NYUSH ED2, rejected for sophomore transfer)\n* Cornell (Sophomore transfer)\n* University of Rochester RD\n* NEU (Sophomore transfer)\n\nAdditional information: I graduate in 2022 and applied for class of 2026"

        "post": "I was once in your spot when applying to colleges, and constantly comparing myself really brought my mental health down. I think that reading a lot of these posts early on is helpful so you have an idea of what you\u2019ll have to accomplish, and of course reach for the stars and set your goals high. But don\u2019t beat yourself up for not being perfect!!\n\nSo many people I\u2019ve seen here are saying they get in with \u201caverage grades\u201d but have a 1400+ SAT and 3.8 GPA. These are amazing grades, definitely not average lol. However, many people I\u2019ve met with average grades (3.0GPA-3.5GPA) and low standardized testing scores still get into great schools and get scholarships. A lot of us first gen and low income students unfortunately have no choice but to sacrifice grades, and you can 100% explain that on your application and still get into T10s. Same with extracurriculars, as not all of us have access to certain prestigious ECs or awards. \n\nSo please, don\u2019t let any of these crazy applicant stories here make you feel bad. Many of these posts were straight up made up or exaggerated. Many others are thanks to wealth and socioeconomic status. As someone who got into several Ivys, had multiple full ride offers, and went to school with other people who got into T10s, I didn\u2019t match anything some of these people had. And many of my classmates at said Ivy and now at another T30 school aren\u2019t particularly the brightest people I\u2019ve met. Honestly, schools in general don\u2019t define you. The average income of most of these top school graduates is $100k, but usually much lower.\n\nSchool truly is what you make of it. I\u2019ve been to an Ivy, community college, and a T30, yet community college was the best and highest quality educational experience I\u2019ve had so far. Be kind to yourself during these applications, and just know that everything will work out."

I have no financial support whatsoever (barring 5500 in fasfa loans), and thanks to my parents being conservative Christians and me being trans, I won't have a home to go back to during breaks.  While me having national merit should've been a ticket to a plethora of full rides, every single one was located in a state that has been actively pushing anti trans laws (Texas, Florida, Alabama, etc.) that I simply would not feel safe to live in.  After looking around, I figured that my best shot at getting the money I needed was NJIT, through the Albert Dorman Honors College.  If I didn't get in, at least the university offers full tuition for NMFs anyway (if I would be able to manage finding a room nearby and all my costs).  Therefore, I didn't see the point in any regular decision, since any top private aid wouldn't beat full tution, and the application fees come out of my own pocket.  I really tailored my application and supplemental essay towards NJIT, and also wrote a mini essay in additional info explaining my whole situation.\n\nThank god this Hail Mary worked.  I know my application was good, but honors is crazy competitive (1500+ sat average, only 150 slots a year) and it's a crazy relief I got in.  Being constantly worried that you won't be able to attend a college right after high school and that you might have to move by yourself out of state or something drastic to afford to live really makes you appreciate the opportunity of a full ride.  I'm super excited for college and can't wait to be a student full time!"

Essays and LORs are really important too. i have many friends who got into great colleges that many people here would say had no shot of getting in. (The whole hype around doing research for the sake of college admissions is especially weird.)\n\n\\- work on your essays early, revising my essays + having people read over them was probably one of the most important things i ever did\n\n\\- LACs rule, everyone should consider them, they were the perfect type of school for me\n\n\\- don't compare yourself to others especially on the internet\n\n\\-college rankings are mostly useless and arbitrary. Did you know that 20% of USNews ranking score is based on a score given by administrators of other colleges on a scale of 1-5? [https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights) it also really doesn't make sense how you can objectively holistically compare completely different schools like Dartmouth vs Caltech vs a state flagship that has 20x the enrollment of Caltech."

I made this post to try to help others like me who have relatively 'average' stats, but **please respect my privacy**! If i get doxxed again I will take down this post permanently, but all I wanted to do with this was to hopefully assist others with my experience of college apps and to just relieve some of the stress that comes with such an arduous, difficult process.\n\nThis is super late considering it's January 2024, but I've wanted to post my results here since I've lurked on A2C and this subreddit for the entirety of my college app season...I'm very grateful for my parents' support and friends' advice when I was applying, and so I hope that my stats and essay info can similarly help others going through the devilish process that is college app season!

Sport (leaving this vague, but no scholarships are offered in the US for this sport unless at a national/Olympic level): captain for a year, 4 year varsity, state top 12\n2. Family responsibilities (in my circumstances, I felt like it was appropriate to list)\n3. Local business job: worked for 3 years, assistant manager for 2 years, often had solo shifts\n4. Keyboard-building (like the only thing I have relevant to my intended major): just a personal hobby I spent time on, no competitions or anything professional lol\n5. English tutor: started in middle school, worked with both local and overseas students, helped improve grammar, fluency, SAT/ACT, essays, etc\n6. Mu Alpha Theta Society: 2 yrs\n7. French Honors Society: 1 yr\n8. Traditional instrument performer (both solo and part of a studio): performed at places such as multicultural events and senior centers, started in middle school\n9. Volunteer cook at a charity: started in elementary school with my family\n10. Volunteer at my local animal shelter: from sophomore to junior year\n\n**Awards/Honors** (nothing crazy lol, I never really focused on academic awards)\n\n1. NMSC Semifinalist -> later Finalist\n2. Sport state awards\n3. AP awards (AP Scholar with Honor, AP Scholar with Distinction)\n4. IL State Scholar\n5. Local conference sport awards\n\n**LORS**\n\n* AP US History teacher: 10/10, she allowed me to read it and asked if I wanted her to make any changes, but it was perfectly fine the way she wrote it (she's also one of my favorite teachers ever)\n* AP Stats and AP CSP teacher: probably a 9/10, I've had her for sophomore and senior year and she wrote me a letter even though I asked her during senior year fall (I didn't know she only took LOR requests if you asked in your junior year)\n\n**Interviews**\n\nHarvard Zoom interview - 9/10 interview imo, was my first college interview ever so I was super nervous, but it turned out to be very chill?? The interviewer asked me the classic 'Tell me about yourself' to start off and after I finished, we branched off my answer into entirely non-academic but very enjoyable and intriguing conversations (e.g. traveling, skiing, coffee, tea). We also then talked about why Harvard (there was a specific program there I referred to for this) and other colleges. I don't know how his perspective of me turned out as a result of the interview, but I personally was very relieved that at least I enjoyed the interview lol.\n\nI'm a coward so no other interviews (I selected no to interviews for many college applications)\n\nI think interviewers from Yale and WashU reached out to me, but I didn't see those until after college app season rip\n\n**Essays** (More on these at the end!)\n\n* Common App: I expanded on my fifth listed activity (English tutoring), since I had asked around and gotten advice from many college friends that the Common App is where you can display non-academic traits and personality best in your application. I took my experience with English tutoring very seriously and the what I've learned from it as a teacher really stuck with me throughout the years. The beginning of the essay was a narrative essay, and then ended with the lessons I've learned and how I'll take them with me into the future (beyond college)\n* Supplementals: I always felt like writing about activities listed lower on my activity list was a nice way to help round out and expand my application (this is also part of the reason I chose English tutoring for the Common App essay). I often wrote the beginning of the essays to be storytelling narratives (also like the Common App), since I felt those helped me express my feelings and experiences at those times best.\n\n**Decisions** (applied ECE / CE everywhere)\n\n*Acceptances*:\n\nU of Arizona\n\nPurdue EA\n\nGeorgia Tech EA\n\nUIUC EA\n\nCase Western RD\n\nUSC RD\n\nPrinceton RD -> commited!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Waitlists*:\n\nWashU RD waitlist -> Acceptance\n\nRice RD\n\nCMU RD\n\nUCLA RD\n\nUPenn RD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nStanford REA\n\nBrown RD\n\nMIT RD\n\nNorthwestern RD\n\nUMich EA deferred -> rejected\n\nUW Seattle RD\n\nDuke RD\n\nCornell RD\n\nYale RD\n\nHarvard RD\n\nBerkeley RD\n\n**Additional Information**:\n\nUp until junior year, I had absolutely no clue about anything concerning or relating to college. I had no idea which colleges were the Ivies or anything like the T20s (many of which I'd never heard of), what I needed to do for the applications, and even my major. I chose my major when I had to write about it for supplementals, since I just couldn't pick before then. As I trudged through college app season, I learned most of what I know now from YouTube videos, some subreddits, and the people around me.\n\n**Some general tips**:\n\n* Start early! Essays take time to write. I started brainstorming my Common App essay in late July, scrapped my idea in early August, and only finished it in late October (right before EAs lmao). I had a friend who was chilling since he finished all of his in September. Be that friend. During senior year fall, you're stacked with homework, college apps, and probably even more. I kept finishing applications barely before the deadline, which took quite a toll on my mentality and my academics.\n* Do research on the colleges! I knew almost nothing about all the colleges I applied to. Many of the colleges on my list were picked based on my parents' opinions and friends I knew who went to a certain college, since I just didn't know where to apply. I'd say it's good to research your plans for both academic and extracurricular experiences in (insert college), so you can mention them in your essays and you have some plans for life beyond academics if you get in.\n* I think essays are the most convincing way for you to get into any school, as I'm almost sure my essays were the driving factor behind my acceptance. Since I never considered academic achievements beyond getting good grades, I didn't have any competitions, awards, research, internships, etc to show for, so I tried my best to focus on writing essays that could demonstrate my character in compelling and intriguing ways.\n\n**Essay info**:\n\nRemember that at the end of the day, the goal of the application is to market yourself to the AOs! I found that the best way for me to do that was to do narrative essays where I could communicate my emotions most interestingly and creatively. For brainstorming, I listed several topics I could write about and started to write each one as if it were my final essay. After that, I could narrow down what topics and essays felt 'right' to me, and which ones could display my character the most accurately.\n\nThis may be personal preference, but I like being more dynamic, dramatic, or even cliche in the essays. Emotive and expressive writing is great for connecting with the AOs, and I think it\u2019s a great way to market yourself as a vivid, appealing, and memorable person, which will definitely make you pop as a person more than just your stats (the AOs will no doubt have seen many, many impressive ones, so the essays are extremely important and compelling in advertising yourself to them). However, it\u2019s still important to REALLY, REALLY, REALLY hammer in how essential your chosen essay topic is to your character and growth as a person.\n\nUltimately, make the AOs want YOU on their campus!!! Don\u2019t just say what you find interesting about and would gain from (insert college), persuade them that you\u2019ll be an excellent contribution to their community! It\u2019s all about mutual exchanges and give and take; convince them that you\u2019ll leave the campus a better place in your own unique way (for supplementals, be as specific as you can about how you\u2019d imagine doing so!)\n\nI cannot even begin to explain how much I relate to this terrible, tedious process of learning, brainstorming, editing, scrapping ideas, and starting over with college apps. Although I can't guarantee I'll be able to answer everything, if you have any questions, I\u2019d be happy to help!\n\nEdit: fixed some formatting issues"

We've grown apart but he does know a lot about my family complications. Also got to take a look at this one so I'm confident enough\n\nHistory teacher: **8/10** she taught me in 8th and 11th and was also advisor for the school MUN club. I told her to showcase my MUN experience in there so it was good.\n\nMaths teacher: **???/10** he talked about my self-studying skills and diligence, though Maths was never my favourite subject so I don't know about this one.

I can't tell if they're good and original topics for sure, but certainly very personal\n\nAmherst 5/10 didn't take them seriously, I left it to a cheap editing service that didn't really match my prose so in retrospect not surprised that I got rejected\n\nMIT 7.5/10 bumrushed them 3 days before the deadline because why not? I was genuine and didn't overthink anything but my creativity wasn't there. I'm expecting to get rejected in RD.\n\nYale 8/10 I did great on everything except the long essay since I couldn't really link it back to Yale's community without it sounding off. Had some pretty creative ideas for the short responses, put a lot of passion in there and my friends really loved them.\n\nDartmouth 9/10 lots of creativity in this one, all my friends loved the responses but I think the first long response could've been better\n\nPrinceton 9/10 showcased a lot of originality in there I think, especially with the short responses. I was a little stuck with the community essay but I'm hoping my writing will cancel out. 6.5/10 for graded paper though I didn't give them a lot of material to work with\n\nHarvard 8.5/10 recycled a lot of it, though I don't think my passions shone through that much. Writing quality was great as usual, and I got feedback from a current Harvard student so good enough?\n\nPenn 9.5/10 got instant inspiration from a friend who called me a fat carrot and somehow I linked that to the social-ness of the school. Plenty of dedication and humour, I think they'll have a blast reading them because I had a blast writing them\n\nStanford 9.5/10 had really great ideas for short responses and my friends helped me with the phrasing. I put in a lot of humour, even more passion so who knows!\n\nColumbia 9/10 not 100% satisfied with the why major essay but I gave them a pretty interesting reading list. Some light-hearted humour, connected a bit to Columbia's community and the UN, and got good feedback so I think it's alright.\n\nDuke 8.5/10 I really like the school but I got too worn out from all the writing so the optional responses weren't as good as I'd like. I'd give the why us essay a 9.5/10 alone since the campus is so pretty!!!\n\nBowdoin 8/10 I recycled from the others and tweaked a little but overall I think it could make for an interesting read.\n\nTufts 8.5/10 managed to put some humour in why us, but the other response wasn't too personalised to the school so let's see\n\nJHU 9/10 still writing the DMP essay but overall was very passionate. JHU had good web design so enjoyed researching too\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nAcceptances:\n\nKnox College (EA)\n\nAugustana College IL (EA)\n\nDeferments:\n\nMIT (EA)\n\nRejections:\n\nAmherst (ED), this really hurt and taught me not to slack off on my supplementals\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI'm going all out and applying to all of these schools for RD since I can't afford to go to the US without a generous school. I like all of them since they do have good programs for PoliSci/IR or great communities, but for Dartmouth I just liked their prompts.

(11)\n* Team Lead for a virtual program under the NYAS (1st place for Outstanding Work) (11)\n* Participant for a virtual business accelerator (2nd place in business pitch) (11)\n* Volunteered for a STEM camp over the summer (11)\n* Volunteered as a tutor for an online platform (11/12) (12th for the summer time)\n\n\\*\\*\\*My extracurriculars section seems like a lot but half of them were all virtual programs due to a lack of access to transportation, so they were a lot less time consuming. The numbers at the end are the grades I was in when I did the activity)\n\n  \n**Awards/Honors**\n\n* Horatio Alger State Scholar (11)\n* AP Scholar (11)\n* A Regional Science Award (12)  \n\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n* APUSH Teacher: 9/10, I think it must've been really well-written because I had him write a LOR for me for my application for the summer research program and got in. He absolutely loved me though and I knew he could write about how good my character was since he had nominated me for some character award at my school. I also did well in his class! I never saw his LOR, but he did tell me that he wrote about how thoughtful I was around others.\n* AP Chem Teacher: 7/10, I think it would be alright. I had her write a LOR for me for something but I didn't get accepted. But, I also had her class for two years and I felt like she could write about me excelling in it and about my character well enough. And I knew she liked me enough and I was one of the few people who actually did well in AP Chem, so I didn't mind asking her to write my LOR.\n\n**Interviews**  \nI was offered an interview by UPenn and was actually terrified because of a previous experience with another university (it went really badly, 2/10 experience that I would not like to think about). I was also kind of scared because when I looked up my interviewer, he was a lawyer and seemed really accomplished, so I was intimidated. However, he was super accommodating and really fun to talk to. We had complications at the beginning of our interview session, with him running late and me missing his call thinking it wouldn't happen. But, I think it was because I was very understanding that it made me likeable. He really only asked me about why I liked Penn, what I did in my free time (to which he then asked me about what I wrote about in my poems), and what I was thinking about doing in the future. I then asked him about his experience at Penn and what he learned during college. Overall, I think my interview was what helped me tremendously because my interviewer said that I would be a great fit at Penn and that he would write me a nice letter at the end (which was so nice of him , omg I was crying after). Needless to say, 10/10 experience for me. \n\n  \n**Essays**  \nI started writing my personal statement in the summer (like immediately after my junior year ended) and spent the majority of my summer writing it. I had 3 different versions of it and it all centered around the same topic: learning how to make use of my time through the image of me waiting after-school for my mother. I had help with my essay through free college advising (shoutouts to my Matchlighters Scholars College Counselor and Matriculate Advisor). The writing was initially garbage, and although it isn't sophisticated, I think I got my point across fairly well in the end. 8/10.\n\nFor my additional information section, I wrote about coming from a low-income household and how I contribute to relieving the stress that comes with it for my parents. This didn't take too long to write as I took what I wrote previously and tweaked it.\n\n**Decisions**  \n***Acceptances:***\n\n* Saint Joseph's University (EA)\n* Ursinus College (EA)\n* UPenn (ED) (for College of Arts and Sciences)\n\n\n**Additional Information/Reflections:**\n\nMy school's actual GPA is weighted on a 5.0 scale, so that's why my UW seems like unusual (at least to me). And if there was one thing I learned, it really is to just highlight your personality and humanize yourself because I think it was my writing and interview that helped humanize me, which may have compensated for my lack of test scores (although my FGLI background may have helped with that, I'm not sure). I had also participated in PIF, but I'm not sure how much impact that had on my application. Anyways, I wish everyone the best of luck in this process. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about anything! :)"

The reason why I took more dual enrollment than AP's is because I was dead set on attending a Florida school and knowing that all dual enrollment credits transfer over, it just seemed like the practical choice to make. Attending Colby, I know that I will have to start from step one, but I welcome it with open arms. I am happy to receive a quality education than just the quantity of classes I have taken.\r  \n\r  \n**Senior Year Course Load:**\n\n(All dual enrollment)\n\n. Biology 1: Cellular Processes\n\n. Biology 2: Biodiversity\n\n. Understanding Visual Arts\n\n. Abnormal Psychology\n\n. Microbiology and Human Diseases\n\n. Elementary Statistics\n\n. Calc II\n\n. Intro to Philosophy\r  \n\r  \nStandardized Testing\r  \n\r\r  \n**SAT :** \n\n1460 (730 M, 730 EWRB)\n\nThe first time I took the SAT I got a 1150 senior year. I locked in for two months (literally didn't touch grass for weeks) and managed a 1460 for the August SAT. It wasn't easy, the months of studying up to that point felt useless because I saw everyone around me already securing their senior scores while I was stuck at a 1150. I had to keep reminding myself of my end goal and that everything will pay off eventually.\r  \n\r \n\n**AP's:**\n\n. Physics 1: 5\n\n. Human Geography: 4\n\n. Environmental Science: 4\n\n. World History: 4\n\n. Statistics: 4\n\n. Biology: 5\r  \n\r  \n**Extracurriculars/Activities:**\n\nThis is where it gets interesting:\n\nSo beginning of Sophomore year was the year I started working at my local Panera. I live in a household of 13 currently and lets just say our finances are not the best. I hated seeing my dad struggling every month just to pay bills so when I was finally ably to work, I tried to alleviate his burden. This was taken advantage of and suddenly I'm expected to pay water, electricity, and internet each month while still attending school. As a sophomore, I was working 40 hour weeks (got a work waiver approved for excruciating circumstances) and soon became the sole provider of the household. I began skipping school in exchange for longer shifts so I was able to make the bills that month. I swear you not, if you look at my official transcript, I have over 80 missed absences for each of Sophomore and Junior year. The worst consequence I got from this was getting my driver's license revoked, but I walk everywhere so...\n\nAnyways, all of my classes were pretty much self-studied throughout Sophomore and Junior year. I am very proud of my AP scores despite the fact that I rarely showed up for the classes. On my free time, I would provide free tutoring for the SAT or intermediate algebra whenever I could.  Didn't really have the chance to join clubs due to work but I emphasized that in my essays.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n**Awards/Honors:**\n\n\r  \n. College Prep Scholar\r  \n. AP Scholar with Distinction\r  \n. National College Match Finalist\r  \n. National College Match Recipient\r  \n. National Hispanic Recognition Recipient\r  \n. Principle\u2019s Honor Roll\r  \n. Honor Roll\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Letters of Recommendation:**\r  \n\r  \nSo, I never read any of my LOR's due to not going to school my senior year. I am an early admission student so I am not required to attend classes at my highschool. I asked my AP environmental teacher, who was also my freshman bio teacher, because she is very aware of my situation and is the sweetest, most understanding teacher any student could ask for. Shoutout to Ms. G!\n\nMy other recommendation was my AP Physics 1 teacher. Now, this was a risky one because again, I never showed up to his class, but he was well aware of my situation. I self-studied his class like crazy, would show up to the mock test and set the curve for the class. Our dynamic shifted dramatically from the beginning of the year to he end cause of course, he saw me as a student who was skipping his class which is completely understandable given the circumstances. When he saw my grades on the test, he put me in a separate room for the torque and rotational motion test because he was convinced I was cheating. Scored in the high 80's. We had a long talk after that test and he saw me in a different light. I have high respects for Mr. M for giving me a chance to explain my situation rather than just basing me on an assumption.\n\nMy guidance counselor is the reason I even considered applying outside of Florida and for Questbridge in the first place. He was the first person who made me feel like i wasn't crazy in my situation and made me realize the resilience I had in myself. \r  \n\n\nI trust that they were all good and would never change the people I chose otherwise.\r  \n\r\r  \n\r  \n**Essays**\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy personal statement focused on the amount I worked while still being determined to pursue a college education. I spoke on tumultuous family dynamics and how my my mother's heroin addiction left my family picking up the pieces financially. I explained how my mindset shifted from \"if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself\" to actually being able to rely on those around you, those being the adults that surrounded me at school. It was the first time I felt I was able to rely on someone other than myself and for that I am forever thankful. \r  \n\n\nAs for my topical essay, I explained how I can't truly understand something until I see the breakdown of it. I have many traits from my mom, that much I can acknowledge, and it absolutely terrified me growing up. I know I have her addictive personality and can easily fall into the wrong habits. It wasn't until I took an Introduction to Addiction and Substance course that I learned what the brain experiences during the time of addiction. It was eye-opening, to say the least, and knowing what my brain was physically going through during times of impulsiveness made it easier to catch on to my own habits. I went into more detail, so this summary isn't really doing it justice lol.\r  \n\r  \n**Decisions**\r  \n\r  \n**Acceptances:**\r  \n\r  \n. Colby College: will be attending on a Questbridge scholarship along with a few outside scholarships\n\n. Florida Atlantic University\n\n. Florida State University\n\n. University of South Florida\n\n. Florida Institute of Technology\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am forever thankful for the adults who have helped me get to this point in my life. I am determined to make the most out of this opportunity. The realization that I no longer have to worry about paying for college has been the biggest weight off my shoulder. Now that I don't have to work 40 hour weeks in college and can just worry about my schoolwork and being involved, I genuinely feel like crying. I know college is going to be hard and I may be starting off at a disadvantage, but I welcome the challenge with open arms\n\nThank you guys for listening to my rants, I wish us all luck in the future."

Fee waivers are fun \ud83d\ude05\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n- Summer Research Program summer before 12th (Don\u2019t want to get specific but it\u2019s in the tier right below RSI if that helps? Usually <10% acceptance rate, and I see people on A2C have mentioned\nit often in regards to STEM summer programs.)\n\n- Unpublished (in any significant capacity) bio research project. Got results but showed my interest (read: fixation) in bio research given limited resources than anything else.\n\n- President/Captain of Academic Decathlon for two years, member for four. Led team to state for the first time and won some scholarships.\n\n- Some advocacy for environmental justice organization (lots of phonebanking and interviewed the director)\n\n- There were other ECs, but they were smaller and supplemented the interest in STEM that I established through whatever research I could do. Not too many on-campus activities, if I\u2019m being honest.\n\n- Mentioned side hobbies like writing and publishing fiction online (~70k hits at the time lol) and a culturally connected pretty unique art hobby that I talk about in my PIQ\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nKinda small on paper and contributed little to nothing but they meant a lot to my personal growth \ud83d\ude2a\n\n- $1000 Academic Decathlon Scholarship (for being the top scorer in the county for my GPA category) \n\n- Perfect speech score in AcaDeca, probably one or two people out of ~500 get this a year in my county. Got a state level award for the same speech.\n\n- 1st Place school creative writing contest award (REALLY REACHING HERE)\n\n**Letter of Recommendation**\n\n- Was requested an LoR by Berkeley and put down my mentor who watched me grow personally even my personal circumstances affected my academics. Probably best rec I could ask for.\n\n- UCLA and UCSD requested additional information, however for some complex reasons I never got around to submitting the forms. Also kept in mind that I fully intended to attend my local CSU or community college in the fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nBecause my stats were not ideal, I\u2019m 99% sure these prevented my application from being an instant reject. Started a week before the due date. Rated on importance not quality haha\n\n1) My passion for a specific area of biology: really important for demonstrating that I had passion outside of the classroom, even if grades didn\u2019t reflect my love for learning. 10/10 importance.\n\n2) Public speaking origin story: demonstrated that I was able to overcome a personal battle and skill issue to deliver an \u2728award winning speech\u2728 + added spice to a STEM heavy application. 7/10 importance.\n\n3) Cultural/Community Impact: Delved into first gen, low income background and reconnecting with my roots through art. 6/10 importance.\n\n4) I heart research: Opportunity to plug previously mentioned research related things and elaborate on my independent project. 8/10 importance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UC Berkeley (!!!! attending)\n* UC Riverside\n* CSULB, Cal Poly, CSUF\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UC Santa Barbara\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UC Irvine\n* UCLA\n* UCSD\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nWrote a VERY thorough additional statement explaining health circumstances leading to GPA. 100/10\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nI\u2019ll leave the judgement up to you. Was it a fluke? Who knows? All I know is that Berkeley took a chance on me when I fucked around and found out. I committed to Cal in the end and finally took a chance on myself. It\u2019s turning out well: I\u2019m doing exponentially better than I ever did in high school, personally and academically.\n\nAnalytically, I have far from an ideal application on paper. I still wonder if I \u201cstole\u201d a spot from someone who worked their ass off with better results. I\u2019ll maintain, though, that my writing saved me. My PIQs and additional statement were crucial to establishing that a) I had legitimate circumstances that affected my high school career and b) I did the best that I could and have the potential to succeed given the opportunity. I also ended up having a neat narrative centered around a natural curiosity in biology and beyond. If you\u2019re in a similar situation, holistically minded schools (like Berkeley, relative to the other UCs) might not be as out of reach as you think.\n\nI\u2019ll end by saying the Berkeley acceptance is an exception, not the rule \ud83d\udc80 But I\u2019m also proof that those exceptions exist.\n\nGood luck y\u2019all!"

For instance, UCs, stanford, CMU, Emory, do not take freshmen year into account when redoing ur HS GPA.\n\nFor supplemtals about academic interest or curiosity, look at what the school is trying to promote (programs, new courses, etc). I saw that emory seems to trying to build its rep on AI and CS stuff, so in my supplemental about intellectual curiosity, I talked about AI and how I wanted to apply it in the medical field ( I am genuinely interested in both med and AI, don't try to fake your interests)\n\nMake up for your GPA with a higher sat or act score.

She helped me get better in junior year. She saw me grow and coached me for TEDx. We are very close. She\u2019s my second mom at this point.\n\n- G9 English/G11 Film as literature Teacher: 100/10 he gave me the English award, he said I was his fave student that year. He knew me for a long time.\n\nEssay:\n- personal statement: struggled to write about myself so I wrote about my alter ego \ud83d\udc80 ?/10\n\n- supplementary essay: wrote about diversity and living in a different country. 7/10\n\nInterview \n- Mount Holyoke College:\nMy interviewer was very kind. It was easy to talk to her; I practiced a bunch of questions so I was able to quickly and adequately answer all of them. Spent 20 min on answering questions, spent 25 min asking questions. The last part is important bc it demonstrates interest!\n\nResults\nAcceptances: \nMount Holyoke College (ED)\n\nRejections:\nNone\n\nTip: \n1. Identify the \u201cpersonality\u201d of the school, cater your writing to demonstrate that you fit in. Tbh I wasn\u2019t very authentic in my essay bc I struggled to talk about myself . But in my essay and throughout my interview, I constantly talked about seeking to learn from diversity, accepting differences, etc, which is what Mount Holyoke WANTS and looks for in students. \n\n2. Reach out to administrators, show interest. I talked to an admissions officer that came to my school. I sent them a lot of email. Beyond making a good impression, they\u2019ve also helped me throughout the whole admissions process regarding financial aid.\n\nEDIT:\nAt first, I did not receive any financial aid, but later, I appealed for aid and received 50k per year. ALWAYS APPEAL FOR AID"

Hope you enjoy + take something away from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Demographics:** White, noncompetitive public school in the South, not low income or legacy\n\n  \n**Major:** Biology (put economics as second academic interest/major where possible)\n\n  \n**GPA:** 4.0 UW (out of 4.0). 4.6 W (out of 5.0). Rank: 3/500+\n\n**Courseload** (not including senior year): 8 APs --> all 5s (included Bio, Chem, Lang, Stat), most of the rest (out of the 24 classes taken 9th-11th) were honors\n\n**ACT/SAT:** 36 ACT, 1580 SAT --> submitted both!\n\n**Awards (all very uncommon for my school, had to search/go out of the way to do most of them):**\n\n* USABO Top 100\n* BBO Gold (top \\~5%)\n* Ranked among top 10 nationally for smaller, somewhat niche olympiad (keeping it vague), qualified for international team\n* USNCO National Qualifier (top 6%)\n* National Merit Semifinalist + perfect score on AP exam (1 of 36 out of 135000 worldwide)\n\nIn additional info, I put a bunch of science olympiad awards (regional/state/invitational) and a couple FBLA awards (economics nat. qual.)\n\n**ECs/Activities (in same order as on CommonApp):**\n\n* Immunology Lab Research Intern (nothing published; compiled extensive data + carried out   \n a variety of wet-lab procedures, worked on research reports alongside postdocs)\n* Outreach Director for large, regional youth service org. (500+ members, direct/coordinate 100+ events, created drive for local homeless network and donated 150+ care items)\n* President, FBLA school chapter (grew chapter 1000%+)\n* Testing Captain, Science Olympiad school chapter (led team to state comp. for first time in years) \n* Youth Outreach Leader @ state chapter of national neurological disease nonprofit (raised $15k+ through awareness fundraiser) \n* Studied sciences @ state Governor's School (sub-15% acceptance rate)\n* Student Body Executive Board, school student council\n* Co-President, Environmental Club (helped raise $1000+ for natural disaster relief; we also do the occasional tree planting!!)\n* Vice President, National Honor Society school chapter (created tutoring program + organized drive that donated 500+ items to local elementary school)\n* Youth Volunteer, local hospital (talk with patients + hand out comfort items; one of my most favorite activities!)\n\n**Essays:** \n\nI don't like the idea of rating essays 1-10 (it's all really subjective); however, if I was to give any of the stuff I wrote a numerical rating, I'd rate my CommonApp 8-9/10 (combined overcoming years-long personal struggle + accepting self for who I was -- not as emotional as it sounds, tied in interests + a few of my ECs that I cared about, overall tried to write the essay in a way that really sounded like me & incorporated humor/understanding/growth)! Everybody I had read the essay really liked it + said it was a good reflection of my personality. \n\nI was honestly pretty happy with my supplementals for all schools. For Duke, I really focused on specifics and tried to repeatedly highlight connections between offerings and my own interests (biology+economics+global health) for the Why Duke essay.\n\n  \n**LORs:** English teacher, math teacher, current counselor (12th), old counselor (9th-11th, extra rec)\n\nOut of respect for my recommenders, I'm not going to individually rank each one --- however, I think all of them probably wrote *at least* a 7/10 recommendation. For both teachers, I connected with them both inside & outside of class and loved talking/meeting with them (the recommendation was an afterthought!). Same goes for my counselors --- my original counselor was my usual first choice for any needed recommendation (we talked A LOT), but she left right before 12th, so I decided to reach out to her for an extra recommendation wherever possible. \n\ntl;dr: Connections matter! Really try to find at least 2-3 people who you feel can truly speak to your strengths both inside & outside of the classroom!\n\n**Decisions:**\n\nNC State (EA) --> Accepted (+ full-ride scholarship semifinalist)\n\nDuke (ED) --> ACCEPTED (& committed! Go Blue Devils!)\n\nWithdrew UNC Chapel Hill application after finding out about Duke\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis process was a loooong one. I wanted to make this post to give hope to those who start their EC's late --- before the start of 11th grade, the only activities I had were #2, #4, #7, and #8, and I was only a member/low-ranking officer in most of them. As much as I'd like to say that the key factors in an application are commitment/impact/dedication/etc., luck plays such a major role in admissions at selective schools that it's hard to really say what matters and what doesn't. **My advice is to focus on things you enjoy, but don't be afraid to go deep into some stuff for the sake of college** (studying for 3 different olympiads at the same time is an interesting experience, but it also really helped me deepen my interest in certain subjects!). \n\nI'm grateful for how my admissions journey turned out, and I wish everyone reading this the best of luck whether you're applying, going to be applying, or already done! Thank you!"

#gobluedevils\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\ni mentioned my AP Scholar award in the \u201cadditional information\u201d section. also, my dook hooks: 1) i received a strong LOR from an alum and 2) i sent in an arts supplement to duke for my instrument. i\u2019m friendly with the dook professor for my instrument and was able to reference her in essays for the music supp. also the said dook prof has been excited for while abt me applying ED and i def got decent ratings at least (on the technical side).\n\n**things i regret/don\u2019t regret but want you to know abt the college app process (these thoughts are unchanged from my original post)**\n\n* PICK AN ED/REA SCHOOL WISELY. try to pick one with a statistical advantage of applying early (georgetown, i\u2019m looking at you with an REA acceptance rate LOWER than your RD acceptance rate LOL), or one where you have legacy/a special connection to. and honestly one that you\u2019d be content with. people have asked me if i feel like i \u201csettled\u201d for duke, and i\u2019d be lying if i said no, but i genuinely don\u2019t think i could\u2019ve gotten anywhere else (besides my safeties) and i\u2019m honestly still over the moon about duke even if some of my friends are headed to mit or ivies haha.\n* revise revise revise personal statement. it\u2019s okay if you still hate it in the end but the college app process is less stressful if you don\u2019t hate ur personal statement and if it\u2019s been thru a lot of edits and been read by people who KNOW the selective colleges\u2019 admissions process/ people who know YOU (teachers, counselors, older friends etc.). i do not recommend having friends in your same grade read ur essays, esp if u know they\u2019re similar to you stats-wise or applying to the same schools.\n* start essays early. i missed out on some parties/hangouts over the summer and during senior fall because instead of staying out late i\u2019d be in my room editing/writing. i can\u2019t say that i regret that - starting essays early and working on them consistently rlly helped my sanity, even if i ended up still hating my personal statement.\n* IF YOU ARE A GIRL IN STEM who wants to apply for duke cs, maybe think about applying for duke engineering instead, esp if your application/ecs can go both ways. cs is a bloodbath rn (has been and will be for future application cycles), and it\u2019s fairly easy to transfer from pratt to trinity. i have a few female friends who also EDed duke but w higher stats than me (esp SAT) and for cs and didn\u2019t get in, so this is just very much anecdotal. this advice doesn\u2019t apply to other schools (like carnegie mellon).\n\nhonestly my mental health was at an all-time low because of my personal statement. i do not recommend. also my sat score was mid af. i will def be looking at my dook admissions file, so might repost (again) in a few months or so once i get to that!!! feel free to ask me qs tho!! \\*(update yes i did look at my admissions file, see below!)\n\n\\*\\*\\*updated dec 2023 with my admissions file:\\*\\*\n\nthe ratings i received on my file:\n\n* note:  for each category, you\u2019re rated on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the best. the file doesn\u2019t tell me what each letter stands for but i\u2019m taking my best guess.\n\n**reader 1:**\n\nC - curriculum: 5\n\nA - academics: 4\n\nR - recommendations: 3\n\nE - essays: 3\n\nEC - extracurriculars: 4\n\nT - test scores: 4.5\n\ntotal: 23.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**reader 2:**\n\nC - curriculum: 5\n\nA - academics: 4\n\nR - recommendations: 3\n\nE - essays: 4\n\nEC - extracurriculars: 4\n\nT - test scores: 4.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntotal: 24.5\n\ntotal for both readers: 48.0\n\npossible points: 60\n\n**notes in the file:**\n\n* personal observation: there were time stamps and i was admitted by the committee at 9 pm about a week before decisions were out (lol)\n* was recommended by admissions for OUSF (still no clue what that means)\n* noted my alum rec letter\n* got a 5 on my music supplement and 5 on interview\n* they summarized my ECs and essays into 5 bullet points (don\u2019t really want to copy and paste them here verbatim tho, sorry!).\n* personal observations continued: noted \u201chigh recommendation\u201d when referencing GC (im guessing my guidance counselor) yet still gave me 3 and 4 overall, i thought was interesting\n\n**reflection:**\n\n* my test scores were mid so 4.5 rating makes sense. i think if u have 1550+ you will get a 5 for test score (i have a 1580 friend who got a 5.)\n* also, aforementioned friend is a recruited athlete (but not for basketball) and got a 5 for EC. they also only had 1 admissions reader.\n* the ratings for my recommendations was lowk surprising - i think maybe overcrowded public school applicants (like me) should avoid over-rating theirs lol. or like just remember your recommendations are probs not as stellar as you think they are.\n* i don't think there is an exact cutoff for ratings that will determine whether or not u get in (bc i have friends with slightly lower that got in) but try to maximize your points ig lol. i do think my point total is on the lower end of duke admits. it makes sense to me that RD applicants need a higher point total to get in (bc RD is so brutal), but that's just my speculation.\n* if you don\u2019t get in, don\u2019t blame yourself because your admissions readers probably didn\u2019t drink enough coffee while reading your application (9 pm is so late)\n\nthanks for reading and ask questions below! instead of dming pls. i will not read essays for internet strangers for free unfortunately, but happy to talk otherwise."

Additionally, Band and Honors Spanish. Also school has strict pre-requisites and these are the highest level classes available to me.\n\nStandardized Testing: (I did apply test optional to all schools, but I want to list these for transparency and for those out there who also are not the best at standardized testing.

Colorguard (3 years): This is the Marching Band colorguard btw. I participated in this all 3 years of high school during the fall, and it is a major time commitment, as in some weeks upwards of 50 hours.\n2. Winterguard (3 Years, 2 at time of app): This is roughly the same as Colorguard, but in the Winter/Spring and an even more extreme time commitment.\n3. Working out (4 years): I put this down just because it has been extremely important to me (I submitted supps about this), and I on average spend from 6-12 hours per week in the gym, and learned how to structure programs while also helping coach peers to achieve significant results.\n4. NHS: This one is a bit of a stretch, but I really don't have much to work with where I live and through my volunteering have learned valuable life lessons that have helped shape who I am.\n5. STEM club: This is one of the handful of extracurriculars I could have had to demonstrate interest in STEM, and I ended up joining because this club goes to elementary schools to introduce science to the kids there which I thought would be fun.\n6. Band (?): I didn't list this directly, but I have been in band for 6 years and play the saxophone and oboe which was mentioned in other areas.\n\nAwards/Honors\n\nList all awards and honors submitted on your application.\n\n1. A Honor roll for 2 years\n2. All region band for 2 years on oboe\n3. AP Scholar with Honor\n4. National Hispanic Recognition Award\n5. Some guard awards that would doxx me\n6. Questbridge CPS and NCM finalist\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\n(From this point on I get pretty lengthy, so feel free to skim, but I hope you enjoy whatever I wrote for those who read it)\n\nAP Language and Composition Teacher: 8/10- I have not read my rec, but I think this one must have been pretty strong. I enjoyed talking to her and would often start and end class with at least some sort of small talk. Through this she learned about my life growing up and what I was going through during the time of the class, and I think we built up a good bond. Another factor is that her class cheating was pretty rampant because of the difficulty of assignments, and essays were handwritten (while timed) to be later typed out and read by her (She was older and her eyesight was failing her) which lead to many people fixing errors and even adding entire paragraphs. She knew this was happening, but she couldn't exactly punish the entire class so she was at our mercy, although the average on essays still wavered between 60-70, yet despite this I left all typos/grammatical mistakes so I think that left an impression on her.\n\nHonors Chemistry Teacher: 7/10- Haven't read this either, but I am really unsure about this rec. We had good conversations often leading to philosophical debates and book recs, but I wasn't the most attentive in his class. This class was basically self-study as he gave the material and expected you to teach yourself which I loved and did pretty darn well, but because of this I didn't do too much in the classroom and mostly spent it talking to him. By the end of it over 1/3 of the class was failing, but I wasn't so I think that may have also helped me a bit. In the end, we even exchanged personal numbers.\n\nInterviews\n\nNo interviews\n\nEssays: (I'm listing some of these as 10/10 bc I can't imagine something else got me admitted, and Minecraft is mentioned in the Caltech supps)\n\n(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\nPersonal Essay: 10/10- I spent a lot of time on this essay. If we considered planning time, I would say it took roughly 7 months total to finalize the structure, message, values, etc. Of course I didn't spend the entire time thinking about it, but from the idea being born to completed it took me that long with maybe 6 drafts (including minor edit run throughs).  I 100% took a risk with this as I didn't follow the traditional personal essay prompt with almost none of it happening in the \"real world\" as I took a very imaginative approach through extended metaphors, but it weaved aspects of my life into it. The main topic of it was the importance of thinking.\n\nQB Topical Essay: 10/10-  My 500 word was about navigating the world of colorguard as someone who was unfamiliar to it. The essay displayed how guard opened me up to people, taught me grit, navigating the biases I received as a straight man in a conservative area in this traditionally feminine activity and how I learned from that. I wrote between 3-5 drafts of this depending on what you consider a draft.\n\nQB Proudest Achievement: 9/10- This was about a letter I wrote to my mom. I wrote this supp from the heart and was passionate, so I managed to get it done in only 2 writings, but it wasn't a unique story per say.\n\nQB Historical Figure/Book Character: 10/10- This was about about meeting a random guy in a historical context and what he taught me. I had a ton of fun writing this one, easily the most fun out of my main application, I had around 8 drafts they were mostly me just changing setting, dialogue, and aspects because I was having fun. Once I settled down on one idea it took me 3 drafts.\n\nQB 35 Short answers: 7/10- These I just typed up somewhat haphazardly and used them to bring some more humanity and teen energy into it, my favorite was writing about how someone told me I was similar to Jake the Dog from Adventure time.\n\nCaltech supps: 10/10- These I'm not going to go as much in depth on as the others, I also recommend checking out the prompts online.  The first essay was a \"why this major\" type essay, and I explained how I felt about the world and how I believed physics and Chemistry are essential to it (I think this was a favorite because it got mentioned in my admit letter).\n\nThe first of the 2nd and 3rd (they are the same prompt, but it requires two responses) I talked about a question we had in chemistry which stumped even the teacher and how I took it home, solved it, and realized the interdisciplinary nature of it brushing upon calculus and physics. My 2nd response was about learning about proofs for the first time alongside my teacher and a bunch of other nerdy math stuff, but it wasn't anything super advanced with the most difficult problem mentioned being the proof of the derivative of lnx (look up khan academy's video if you are curious).\n\nThe next prompt is about being a creator and I wrote about a farm I made in minecraft skyblock (I promise I'm not trolling \ud83d\udc80) and how I used physics to create it because I made a real life contraption thingy out of Vicks VapoRub and a drinking glass to help automate it.\n\nThe final supp was asking about unequal opportunity and I just used this to write more about my life. I would elaborate on this more, but it is a bit personal.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAcceptances:\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech)\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nI had no leadership positions, minimal club involvement (in comparison to others), enjoyed high school, played video games, and pursued what I loved these last couple years. Honestly, after my experience I feel like anyone can find success in college admissions as long as they dedicate the time to it. Granted I spent tons of time cramming information about college these last 7 months because I didn't even know college was a possibility for me until midway through my junior year, and I was planning on just joining the military. As you saw earlier, I didn't have the best test scores and where I live they don't cut it for scholarships so I had almost lost hope. Although I managed to turn it all around and end up at a top school without having to pay much at all for the education while also completely uprooting my life in a good way while changing the trajectory of my life significantly.\n\nThe best advice I can give as clich\u00e9 as it is, BE AUTHENTIC! I really did think people lied to me when they said this, but I was authentic in my essay not to optimize admission rather because I felt horrible being unauthentic and it made me feel like I was lying. Try as best as you can to write something only you could write on paper.\n\nI sacrificed time with family and friends for a few months, but in the grand scheme I don't regret it (neither do family/friends) because I managed to do something seemingly impossible for both me and my mother. I was hesitant to post my results with my stats, but I want others in positions similar to mine who just by chance might see this post in passing to know that if there is a will there is a way. I can't promise everyone will find success like I did, but if my post helps at least one person out there I will be overjoyed."

Also, at the time I was applying, they were allowing students to go to Duke University for their first year due to COVID-19."

Simply by knowing that detailed results will be posted swiftly and publicly, colleges are motivated to strictly abide by the court's terms\n\n2) **Insight into allowed use of race-based topics** The SFFA ruling allowed applicants to discuss how race impacted them - by \"inspiration\" or overcoming \"discrimination\" or otherwise. /r/collegeresults will be a better forum by allowing discussion of essays, ECs and supplementals that provide solid examples how to navigate this new world.\n\nAs another suggestion, the templates might be updated similar to how AOs see the info - remove the line for race/ethnicity and remove URM from \"hooks\".\n\nMore template suggestions: provide insights into the income field (for instance, being Pell Grant eligible is a big deal), remove or deemphasize rank as it is rarely available, remove SAT II, etc"

My impression is that Columbia merely uses academic achievement as a bar to qualify for admission while the deciding factor is essays (unless you're at Olympic level or something). I've seen people much more academically impressive than me get rejected, I've seen people whose achievements got them into every other ivy get rejected by Columbia, and I've seen people who apply to all the ivies and only get into Columbia. But maybe i have no idea what im talking about and im speaking rubbish.\n\nfeel free to ask any questions!"

I used a wall as a motif for my social anxiety and gave a series of events that let me break out of this wall (both actions from myself, and encouragement from others). Overall the writing felt a little chaotic and not perfectly written IMO, and I ran out of space for a solid conclusion, but the essay kind of served to justify my lack of extracurriculars I think.\n\nWashU specific essay was about mental illness in my family/friends and how it has changed my outlook on people and how I have learned to support those in my communities.   \n**Decisions**\n\n  \nAccepted to WashU ED1!!!\n\nDeferred Case Western (Did not show interest)\n\nI did not expect to get accepted to WashU because of my extracurriculars but I somehow did and I attribute that to my essays/recommenders (and of course hooks+luck)\n\n  \n"

Varsity member for all 4 years of high school. Competed at invitationals, regionals, and states. Regionals champion for like 20 something years. placed top 10 in states my sophomore year. We used to be a real powerhouse team in New York, but COVID hit us super hard and  we're still in the recovery process.  In the common app I mentioned 25 medals over 4 years, how I managed the club treasury for any invitationals we go to and any materials we buy for events, and how I act as a proctor and test writer for the invitational that our high school hosts.\n2. **Research Intern:** Conducted research at local medical university to find climate change's effects on fly feeding patterns. Not published or anything crazy like that, just thought it was a good way to gain lab experience. Prof pretty much taught me the protocol and let me go crazy after\n3. **Cello:** did school chamber for 3 years, also member of regions top orchestra for 2 years (not school affiliated). Never did all state or anything like that (not good enough lmao).\n4. **Science Honors Society**: President (12) meh, exactly what it sounds like. we organize volunteer opportunities for stuff like science experiments at library, volunteer at a farm to donate to local food pantry, etc. i honestly don't know why i put this up so high \n5. **School Newspaper:** Managing Editor (10-12). Went to local journalism conferences, edited and wrote articles, in charge of print layout \n6. **Suicide Awareness Club:** Treasurer (12). Managed funds for all events, helped organize events with AFSP and local mental health resources. \n7. **Spikeball Club:** Cofounder, what can I say I'm just good at smacking balls. Made this club with friends. I once broke my wrist while diving for a spike, so you know I'm dedicated \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\n8. **AAPI Cultural Heritage club:** K-pop dancer for our annual AAPI heritage assembly. Love dancing, doesn't mean I'm good at it lol\n9. **Model United Nations:** just a delegate, didn't really do much. I find the socializing more fun than committee debate \n10. **Lifting:** lol, I was contemplating whether or not to include this but it's taken a significant amount of my time in HS and I actually enjoy it so I was like why not. yummy dopamine \n\n**Awards/honors:** \n\n1. Science Olympiad big invitational medal \n2. Science Olympiad states medal \n3. Science Olympiad states medal \n4. National Merit Semifinalist (barely on the cutoff)\n5. AP Scholar with distinction \n\n**Letters of Recommendation** keep in mind these ratings might be completely inaccurate since I never read the letters\n\n* **AP Chemistry Teacher:** (7/10). My chem teacher in 11th grade. No clue what she wrote about me, but I was a good student in her class and often stopped by when I needed help with chemistry for Science Olympiad. \n* **AP Physics Teacher:** (10/10). My physics teacher this year (12th grade), but also my Science Olympiad coach. Was with me throughout all of high school, seen me at my lowest lows and highest highs (and the lows were pretty low). He was really the only one to see my entire development right from the beginning of high school. He told me he started crying while writing my letter, so I'm sure it was beautiful\n* **Counselor :** (6/10). Same thing with the chem teacher, I wasn't super close with him but he knew I was high achieving. Probably closer to him than my peers were, since I had meetings with him to discuss summer plans (basically let him know what I was doing lol). He wrote me an email earlier to congratulate me which was really nice \n\n**Interviews**\n\n* **UPenn Interview:** I think it went really good. It lasted about an hour, and the interviewer basically asked me two questions: Why Penn, and what do you do outside of school. It was honestly super chill. He talked about his experience with Penn and answered all my questions, and at the end he said he thought I was a great fit!\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Common App: wrote about growth and change of perspective on life after death of friends. won't go into it more because its personal, but I did a lot of introspection during the writing process, I think it is something that I can be proud of.  My AO sent me an email later that said she thought my personal statement was very moving, so I think this essay was a major reason as to why I got in  \n* Penn supplementals: I am proud of them, but they are probably very standard essays. I pretty much told them straight up what my life at penn would look like if I was admitted. I tried to create a narrative with each one, but overall didn't do anything \"quirky\" with them. \n   * Gratitude Letter: I wrote the letter to my late friend set in a time where they were still here (the admissions officers didn't know this, so it would just seem like a letter to a friend without the hidden meaning behind it). I often journal with prompts similar to this, so the writing process was familiar to me. \n   * Why community: I talked about existing clubs at penn, why I wanted to join them and how I would contribute to the community through them. These clubs were related to my cello playing, and science olympiad participation. \n   * Why engineering: talked about my research and how penngineering facilities would grant me more opportunity to expand my previous work and go into other fields\n* nothing else because I am a procrastinating slacker hehe \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD**\n\n* Binghamton (EA): >!Accepted!<\n* UPenn (ED): >!Accepted!

It didn't have anything on the international level, or even much on the national level, so I'd like to believe my academics and essays pulled their weight\n* Use the college application process to find more about yourself! Especially with your personal statement. If you don't walk away with an acceptance you wanted, you at least will have walked away with a more complete view of yourself \n* i binged this subreddit over the summer, soooooo i hope you guys enjoy my contribution to the content ocean \n\nyou guys all got this! feel free to ask any questions "

Because teachers write short excerpts about students being inducted into cum laude, I got to kind of get a sneak peek at what he thought about me as a student. He highlighted my interdisciplinary interest and my desire to help others reach an understanding of the material. I supplemented that in my brag sheets by talking about how the unit on photosynthesis helped me understand the process of an art project I was doing. I also connected my love for biology to my environmental activism\n\nAmerican Lit teacher - this one is a doozy. He really loved me most of the year, and told me how excited he was to write my rec letter when I asked him, but seemed to vaguely dislike me in the last two months of school (I might be overthinking this though). In my brag sheet to him, I tried to highlight my love for collaboration + my spike of environmental science and gender studies (talked a lot about an essay I wrote in his class on Amy Lowell's use of nature imagery to convey her sapphic desire). In the cum laude sneak peek, he talked about my originality.\n\nDebate coach  - really loved him, and I think he liked me pretty well. Highlighted my debate achievements + probably talked about my love for queer theory (which helped give substance to my intended major in gender studies since I didn't have any ecs relating to that).  \n\n\n**Interviews**  \nvideo introduction: really proud of this. basically taught myself video editing over the weekend. Had a broad theme of finding beauty through my Polaroid camera, and I tried to highlight aspects of myself (art, debate, love for star trek, experiments with makeup) that I didn't get to expand on in my supplemental essays. I think it humanized me.  \n\n\n**Essays**\n\nI think essays are so contextual to who's reading them, so I'm not sure how to rate them. I will guestimate again though.\n\ncommon app (9.5/10): spent so long on this and rewrote it five times. had two friends + english teacher look over it and they made it so much better. It was about how my dad's homophobia/tension with my queer identity/feminity influenced my environmental activism. Used the central motif of the pansy (which is both as a homophobic insult and a flower) to potray this tension. It started out as a sob story but I think as I rewrote it, I captured the nuance of my dad and I's relationship (and how his chinese identity and all the racial preconceptions that come with it influenced his perception of feminity)  \nhere's the ending: For as much as those who hurl \u201cpansy\u201d like to portray queerness as frail, the fatal contradiction is that the pansy thrives in the wild. They survive and never lose their colors. As a pansy, I, too, will never hide my colors again....Pansies flourish together. You\u2019ll never find one alone. Defiantly, they bloom in rocky outcrops, sand fields, wastelands. To my father, to be a pansy means to be weak. I will show him it means to thrive, to flower.  \n**supplemental essays**  \n**open curriculum** (9/10): talked about the importance of unifying queer theory and environmental science, and how it can combat heteronormative preconceptions scientists hold that ignore same-sex behavior in nature. Also talked about a specific senior thesis I saw at Brown's IBES (environmental science) department that related to it.\n\nPro tip for this essay: you should cite Professor Morgan, who created the Open Curriculum. AO's will eat that up  \n**community** (9/10): talked about how seeing the photographs of Jiro Onuma, a queer Japanese immigrant who was interned during World War II, inspired me to use photography as a way to work through my identity as an Asian-American. I also submitted an art supplement which I think strengthened this essay a lot.  \n**simple joy** (7-8/10): talked about how taking baths let me escape the constant pressure to be efficient in school - it was a little generic  \n**three words** (8/10): I did a three-word phrase instead of three adjectives. I'm quirky like that.\n\n**extracurricular** (9/10): environmental organization and how it taught me the importance of community  \n**teach a class** (9.5/10): it probably isn't actually a 9.5/10 but I loved this essay. talked about how I wanted to investigate the lives of secretly queer politicians/power holders during the cold war (think Roy Cohn and Edgar Hoover) who persecuted queer people, and what their cognitive dissonance tells us about the limits of identity politics. I think this essay really showcased my love for queer theory and again helped justify that intended major.  \n**why brown** (7-8/10): pretty good. talked about brown's commitment to being carbon-neutral by 2040 and how that relates to my activism/life goals\n\nArt supplement\n\nHad my art teacher look at it, and he thought it was pretty good. I do photography as a hobby, so it probably wasn't art school quality, but I think it had some pretty good pieces. I had a few anthotype prints, which use chlorophyll to print photos instead of ink, in there, which i think really highlighted how I connect art with environmental science\n\nDecisions  \nAcceptances: Brown ED >:)\n\nDeferred: UChicago (EA) - came out before I could withdraw my application.  \nReflections:  \nsome of this will be specific to brown, but I think it's pretty applicable to college admissions in general. I am by no means well-versed in college admissions, so take this with a grain of salt. I think my intended major/spike was what got me in. Brown loves people who have disparate interests that they're able to connect/use to supplement each other. For me, it was environmental science, queer theory, and art. Throughout my application, I tried to interweave them together, and I think that really helped me. Colleges don't want the real real you because we're messy and illogical. They want a curated you. That doesn't mean you should be inauthentic. It means you should really spend time thinking about what 2-3 things you are really passionate about and using your supplemental essays, weave those things together into a cohesive narrative.\n\ngood luck you guys <3"

Independent Research on genetics & health disparities, published two papers and presented at virtual conferences/science fair.\n2. Co-Founder/Developer of AI web app, reached 300+ subscribers, filed patent for our model.\n3. Paid intern at research organization, developed statistical models for clinical trials. Submitted paper for publication.\n4. President of STEM competition club & Head Coach of MS chapter of club. HS club was kinda meh, but did place in regionals during COVID season. MS club was very good, team was consistent national qualifier and regional champs.\n5. Speech & Debate: Competed pretty consistently, qualified TOC for all of HS and placed in several tournaments\n6. Co-President of Math Team & Math Honors Society\n7. Clarinet Player & member of Youth Orchestra, also uploaded clarinet song covers on Youtube (mostly for fun lol). Also did indian classical music, learned & performed since MS, also performed at a world fair.\n8. Co-President of World Cultures Club founded in senior year (was mostly an excuse for our friends and I to cook food lol)\n9. Volunteer at local nursing home, assisting elderly patients.\n10. Caretaker for Grandma.\n11. Additional info: Participated in Yale Young Global Scholars (YYGS) and Wharton Global Youth Program. Wondering if I should have included it in my activities section (parents said we should diversify so we put it in additional). \n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. Coca-Cola Scholars Semifinalist\n2. 3x TOC Qualifier\n3. Runner Up at State Science Research Competition\n4. 2x Statistics Award at Science Fair\n5. 3rd Place Winner in Video Contest on Teen Mental Health\n6. Additional info: National Merit Semifinalist, Rensselaer Medal Award, AP Scholar with Distinction, other local math/science fair/debate awards \n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n* Counselor \u2014 she's fine, very standard but knows about me being advanced in math, reached out to her a lot during the application process mostly because of Coke scholars and stuff. She did say she thought I would get in somewhere good so generally this rec served its purpose.\n* AP Seminar teacher \u2014 had them in junior year, they were pretty good I think. The teacher was the head of the science department so he did know about my research and STEM skills. Probably nothing special but definitely good.\n* AP Physics C \u2014 really nice person, very friendly, she's also the sponsor for our culture club. Knows me pretty well and when I asked for a rec for Regeneron STS she did say she wrote an amazing one and hopes I get it (probably cuz our school has never had a qualifier lol).\n* Internship supervisor \u2014 pretty good, did a lot of work myself and was generally impressed with me. Not much to say.\n* MS STEM club sponsor \u2014 very good, she's been really involved with the team and reaches out to me a lot. The team's success has definitely helped and she even wanted to write a rec for me. Would say it was really solid.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT interview: was generally pretty ok, interviewer was very enthusiastic and we talked a lot about research and my interests. Pretty insightful and nice overall.\n\nPenn interview: Was ok, interviewer seemed really tired and wanted to get it over with so it wasn't as long as I wanted. Only thing that was noteworthy was that he was interested in my AI app and wanted to know more about it, otherwise nothing much.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App: I think it was cool, I wrote about rapping and making youtube videos and how it inspired me to take risks and not be afraid. I liked that it wasn't something really cliche or about academic stuff, and just tapped into more of my fun side.\n\nMIT supps: I think they were generally fine. I also liked how I didn't just talk about academic stuff like research (except for why major lol). I talked about forming a dance group with my friends and overcoming adversity, as well as tying our culture club to uniting different diverse groups of people. For the pleasure essay, I talked about my love of films and film statistics which was pretty neat. Overall I think they were decent.\n\nPenn supps: I also think they were pretty nice. Wrote the gratitude one about my mom, talked about diversity of languages and meeting different people in Wharton Global Youth for the community essay, and my love of film tying into CS and engineering for the engineering essay. For the M&T essay, I talked about my AI app and wanting to get into startups and innovative tech (though this kind of seemed like a stretch).  \n**Decisions**\n\n* UPenn M&T (wharton + engineering) ED: accepted to second choice (engineering & applied sciences) -> committed!!!!!\n* MIT EA: deferred (withdrawn)\n* Other EA colleges/planned RD colleges: state school, GTech, Duke, Columbia, Brown, Princeton, Harvard, CMU, Yale, Cornell, JHU, etc. (can't remember others lol)\n\n**Reflection**\n\nOverall I am glad this is over for me. A lot of people told me that I was underhanding by going Penn ED but honestly, I didn't vibe with most of the other ivies and Penn was probably the school I would've preferred to go to aside from MIT. But I didn't really expect to get into MIT (didn't have any olympiads, also literally could not qualify AIME my entire HS career, got to a point where I kinda disliked these types of competitions anyway). The M&T program was kind of also a long shot (don't rly have a business background that much) but it was worth a try and getting engineering is pretty cool and I'm happy with Penn overall."

AP scholar with distinction (\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80) (really scraping the bottom of the barrel here)\n\nOn the optional music supplements/portfolios (for MIT and Stanford), I also included some of my music awards, such as two awards from my school orchestra program, Certificate of Merit lvl 9 (getting lvl 10 this year \ud83d\udc80), and regional Honor orchestra\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nI got 4 LoRs, but I haven't read them so I can't rate them tbh:\n\n* AP Lang teacher \u2014 had them in junior year, they were great, I love them sm. the letter probably wasn't anything crazy bc they write like 50 letters every year \ud83d\udc80 but I do think I was a unique student in their class bc I always wrote way more than required for essays, just bc I wanted to, so I was kinda notorious for that \ud83d\udc80\n* AP Calc AB/BC teacher \u2014 had them for two years now, love them sm bc they're so nice and funny. I think the letter was probably good because I was the first student they wrote for this year \ud83e\udd79\n* AP Music Theory/other music classes teacher \u2014 had them for three years ! they are awesome and so sweet and literally the best ever. probably my favorite teacher of all time and definitely the one I'm closest to. this letter only went to MIT and Stanford as part of the music portfolio tho :( would've used it more if I did the RD schools I was planning to do\n* UC linguistics professors \u2014 this letter also only went to MIT and Stanford. I didn't know them very well bc I work under one of their PhD students, not them, but we had a fun little get together one day where they just sorta interviewed me to get to know me better, and also a section of the letter was written by the PhD student who does know me rly well\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* MIT interview: it went well over all, the lady was rly nice, felt more like a conversation than her just asking me questions. but she did request a list of my ecs/accomplishments before the interview. lasted a little over an hour.\n* USC scholarship interview: pretty short, only about 20 minutes. it was lowkey terrifying bc the president of vse was there, but everyone in the panel was super nice and the questions weren't too bad either, just sorta asked me to elaborate on some of my ecs\n* I didn\u2019t get a Stanford interview !\n\n**Essays**\n\n* UC PIQs: I wrote these ones first over the summer, had them done by like July. I think they were pretty good and nice to start with bc they were very easy. I did questions 2 (about my creative side through music, writing, game dev, and programming), 4 (about academic opportunity of going to japanese school), 6 (about my interest in technology and specifically human-computer interaction), and 8 (about the ways going to art school has helped me grow)\n* Common App main essay: spent so long on this bc i came up with like 4 different drafts with completely different ideas but eventually I settled on the one I submitted, which was basically about how all my vastly different interests/hobbies (music, writing, linguistics, game dev) sorta evolved and how I became interested in them. sorta trying to tie them together because they're all so different \ud83d\udc80\n* MIT essays: tbh I thought they were kinda rushed bc they were the last EA supps I did (since I applied to four EAs \ud83d\udc80). but i guess they were good enough to get me admitted so! I won't get into specifics about what I answered to each prompt, but basically I tried to emphasize through my essays that I am a very interdiscplinary person and I intend to use my education at MIT to combine arts/humanities with technology\n* Also for MIT, I did the music portfolio (submitted my compositions bc I was too lazy to record videos of me playing violin), and the maker portfolio (submitted screenshots/videos of some of my games). The maker portfolio had a few short answer questions that I think were really nice to fill out bc I could explain more clearly why I do gamedev and the specifics about what I do\n* Additional information sections: wrote about why I transferred to art school in 10th grade, why I decided to learn Japanese (tying it to cultural appreciation and also linguistics and also my dead grandfather? it was a wild one, lowkey like another common app essay itself), and for MIT's question about family I wrote about how my queer identity is at odds with my culture/religion and therefore my family doesn't know/accept me\n\nI think I'm generally a good writer, since I literally do creative writing as a hobby, so most of my essays were pretty good \\^-\\^\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* Drexel EA (Computer Science) \\[w/ Presidential Scholarship\\]\n* MIT EA (intending Course 21E) \\[committed!\\]\n* USC EA (Computer Science Games) \\[w/ Trustee full tuition Scholarship and Viterbi 10k scholarship\\]\n* UC Irvine (Game Design and Interactive Media)\n* UC Santa Cruz (Computer Game Design)\n\n**Waitlists/Deferrals:**\n\n* Georgia Tech EAII: Deferred and I decided not to continue w it\n* UC Davis: offered a spot on the waitlist, I decided not to take it\n* UCLA: offered a spot on the waitlist, I decided not to take it\n* UC Santa Barbara: offered a spot on the waitlist, I decided not to take it\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n* UC San Diego\n* UC Berkley\n* Stanford\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* I was originally going to apply to 5 more schools in RD, but after getting into MIT, I decided to spare myself the time, money, and effort of doing those. so I pretty much didn't apply anywhere RD except Stanford (which was an earlier deadline anyway bc of music portfolio)\n* I was extremely shocked to have gotten into MIT bc,, well,,,, I figured I had a below average SAT math score, no leadership (I have social anxiety <3), no STEM ECs (besides a bit of programming expressly for game development), and no crazy international awards or high impact ECs (most of them were literally hobbies). I thought I wouldn't stand out compared to other high income Asians from California. But I've come to realize that probably what did make me stand out and seem unique is that I was very genuine in my application. Even though my ECs are seemingly a hodgepodge of random shit, I only did them bc I really cared about them, and I wrote about them in a way that showed my passion. Plus, I think my ideal of combining art and STEM is something that matches MIT's institutional goals, so there's good fit there. all in all, I think a big factor of what gets really really accomplished kids rejected from MIT, while kids like me get in, is that difference of institutional fit\n* I mainly wanted to make this post bc I wanted to show that it's possible to be a pretty normal kid with a normal life and still get into a top school like MIT. I wasted so much time watching Instagram reels, playing Genshin Impact, and reading/writing gay fanfiction, and I always slept at least 7 hours every night. But I still made it to MIT! So don't sacrifice your sleep and health and sanity just to get into these top schools. My best advice really is to be genuine, take care of yourself, and do what you love!"

Research internship at a national laboratory. Applied ML models in Python and some additional analytical modeling (11th).\n2. State science fair research project. Bioinformatics category (11th).\n3. Research project with a professor on formal proofs and verification of algorithms. Not published (12th).\n4. Internship at a local software company. Mostly assigned to organizational tasks but helped build UI for an internal tool (10th).\n5. President of competitive programming club at high school (11th-12th).\n6. Science Olympiad (10th-11th). Top five placements at state level and invitationals in Codebusters.\n7. Paid mathematics summer camp on graph theory with a 50% acceptance rate (10th).\n8. Paid AI summer camp with an unknown, but likely generous, acceptance rate (9th).\n9. FIRST robotics. No significant awards (9th).\n10. Volunteering at various coding events, e.g. [Code.org](https://Code.org) (9th-12th 40hrs aggregate).\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) Gold Division\n2. State science fair first place\n3. Congressional App Challenge\n4. National Merit commended\n5. AP Scholar w/ Distinction\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n1. 11th grade calculus teacher. Okay relationship and above-average performance, but the letter may potentially have been dry and businesslike. 6/10.\n2. 11th grade history teacher. Decent relationship, as I met with him many times in office hours, but I was a typical student in terms of performance. 6/10?\n\n**Interviews**\n\n1. Harvey Mudd College: generally went well. Most of the questions my interviewer asked came directly from their website ([https://www.hmc.edu/admission/connect/interviews/](https://www.hmc.edu/admission/connect/interviews/)), so I had been prepared. However, I neglected to look into clubs at Harvey Mudd in advance and struggled on the relevant question. Interviewer also threw a curveball at the end about my personality based on one of my hobbies, but I was able to answer it. 8/10.\n2. Rice University: also generally went well. The interviewer said he thought I was a strong candidate but he wasn't too familiar with my activities since he came from overseas. 8/10.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* Rice University (ED)\n\nAll other applications withdrawn or aborted.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\nRice mails a small banner to each acceptee highlighting something the AOs believe was noteworthy in their application. Mine read something along the lines of \"we're excited with what you will do in computational modeling.\" I speculate that emphasizing my research interests in bioinformatics/applied CS may have helped in my admission since this is a relatively niche field and could have been perceived as a unique interest.\n\nIf I had the chance to repeat high school, I would spend less time procrastinating and more time on my hobbies, namely my research interests in CS and bioinformatics. I think that if I had advanced further in research (e.g. publications or more research awards), I would have had more self-esteem when applying to college and more information to include in my essays. Fortunately, I was still admitted to my first choice, so everything worked out in the end.\n\nEdit: format."

She is however a very intelligent person and an amazing writer at that, and I trust not only her assessment of my character but her exemplification of that. \n\n- Engineering teacher, 9/10 - we haven't known each other for very long, but I became his assistant quickly after I joined his class because he saw my affinity and enthusiasm for the subject, both of which he explains in the letter. He also goes into detail about what I have done as his assistant, and the type of student + person I am, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal essay - 8/10. Not some crazy personal experience; it's about writing, actually. Writing is my home, it's the thing I go to do at the end of the day to relax, and I exemplified in the essay how it helped me through times like COVID where I was disconnected from my friends, and also help me find myself and my queer identity, among other things. Let me restate that I'm a *writer,* and I'd say it was pretty well written, lol. Had many people look at it, and my hook is really good, and most people didn't have many edits to make. \n\nSupps - 7/10. honestly? Don't remember em. Didn't do a whole lot.

This can double as a chance me if y'all have any input. \n\nBUT SERIOUSLY. BINGHAMTON??? The funny part is that they don't have my major (and unless they caught in to my internship being for what it is in the additional information section) and I didn't realize until much after I had applied. Thankfully it was during SUNY week (in which the app is waivered) so it was at no cost to me but dang. Was definitely not expecting a deferral from Binghamton of all places. I know that I'm not the top 1% of students, but I didn't think a SUNY would be my first non-acceptance, either!"

I never really gave college stuff much thought throughout high school and my parents never pushed me to do very much. And honestly, I didn't even realize high schoolers COULD do research or start nonprofits or whatever, since nobody around me was doing that stuff either.\n\nI guess my question is: am I crazy to think I have a chance at top schools? And if anyone has thoughts or advice for students like me, that would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm in a weird position and my ECs are just really holding me back."

I think my Why Brown/Major essay was also good in that I really communicated how I would take advantage of the Open Curriculum.\n\nIf anyone has any more specific questions about my app or applying to Brown LMK AND DM ME!!

        "post": "(stats at the bottom)\n\nOkay I know 1480 (790 maths 690 english) isn't bad for many colleges, but it's pretty bad for upenn (avg score is 1500+) and especially for a chinese international male applying for engineering..\n\nI took the SAT 4 times: first 2 i got around 1400 and the last two i got 1470. I worked my ass off for the last two SAT - I spent hours studying all the theory for english grammar and techniques for reading. But I was always stuck at around 680 English..\n\nEnglish was just something I couldn't get a grasp off. I asked all my friends who got 1550+ how they manage to do so well in the English section, and most of them said it just comes out naturally. I felt soooo demotivated that all my hard work (compared to my friends) were wasted. I thought I was basically done with getting into T10 schools, thinking that i had to go test optional.\n\nIn the end, I decided to submit my 'shitty' 1480 as adviced by some councillors. Eventually, I got super lucky and got accepted to upenn '28.\n\nLooking back, I didn't know whether submitting my sat score to upenn would subtract from my application or not.. but the point of this post is to encourage people who have 'low' SAT scores that you can still definitely get into a good US uni with other decent stats.\n\nCongrats to those who got into their Early. And to those who are doing RD, good luck and remember to shoot your shot and trust the process.\n\nStats:\n- 44 predicted in IB\n- 1480 sat (790 maths 690 english)\n- top british boarding school\n- 11 A*/9 in IGCSE\n- decent activities (top activities: semi successful non profit, national level swimmer, club president, internship)\n- mid honours (finalist in international science bee, chem and maths competition, faculty prize)\n- rly good essays (i think)\n- decent recommendations (except 1 - teacher caught me watching valorant in class lol)"

For me it worked out because these were the two teachers I was closest to, they taught AP, and the subject aligns with my intended major.\n\nRec #1: AP World History teacher, I was close enough that he knew personal stuff about family situation. Despite the fact that I fell asleep in his class all the time, I think it actually worked in my favor as he saw I still did well despite everything happening. He valued hard work above any kind of intelligence or natural talent. I have no idea what he wrote as he got a ton of requests, but I trust him. **(8/10)**\n\nRec #2: AP U.S History teacher, I was super super close to her. She moved away but we still keep in touch and she was absolutely fundamental to my entire application because a summer program she sent me to helped me get all of these opportunities. She knew everything about me, both academically and personally. **(10/10)**\n\nRec #3: The chief of staff for the senator I interned for. I loved her, we clicked really well on a personal basis and she was impressed by me throughout the internship, so this letter was definitely key. **(9.5/10)**\n\n**Interviews**\n\nNone :)\n\n**Essays**\n\nI think my essays were probably what tipped my application over the edge after everything else. The rest is pretty average ivy league hopeful, but I loved my essays and I think they helped me stand out.\n\n(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\n**Common App:** I wrote about the summer program (#6 on activities list) and how it healed me. The structure started with some family stuff, then the summer program, then the moment where I started a bit of a revolution at the program. I used the metaphor of fire throughout and the way it changed. I **loved** this essay. (9/10)\n\n**Supplements:** There were 7 supplements for Brown and I think all of mine were good. I tried to include different aspects of myself as much as possible and came up with unique angles for each topic. The shortest essays were the absolute hardest, but that might be because I like to write. (9.5/10)\n\n**Brown Video Introduction:** Not an essay, but it fits here. My topic was based on something my brother said: \"if it scares you, do it.\" I basically used that as the thread to tie together lots of different topics, from some elaboration of my ECs to hobbies to random little segments (ten seconds of my video was about taking selfies with random bearded men to win a bet). I spent so long editing it and it was super fun to make. (9/10)\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nAcceptances:\n\nBrown University, ED (committed)\n\nDenver University, RD\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder, RD\n\ni applied to 19 but obviously they were all rescinded before notifications could get back, so no waitlists or rejections.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\npm for any other details!"

I emphasized how this would translate to me as a person and what I would bring to the college (essentially a Why You? essay).

Addressing this, the country distributes iodine-fortified salt uniformly across regions, overlooking the impact of varied landscapes on iodine stability. This study went into sub-national iodine presence and levels in fortified salt, examining the correlation between topographical changes and iodine stability. Samples from point of sale and consumption across four out of seven provinces were studied using the redox titration method with a narrow error margin (+/- 0.35). Although no significant link emerged between topography and iodine stability, a marked decline in iodine content from point of sale to consumption was seen. The iodine concentrations at the point of consumption sometimes fell in the absolute lower limit of  WHO standards, emphasizing a critical issue in the salt distribution chain and a lack of consumer awareness of salt storing practices. \r  \n\r  \n\\#7: Co-founded Interdisciplinary Research Network - IRNetwork.co: Established Global Research Network: Connects students from challenging circumstances with mentors, guiding them from research questions to publications. \r  \n\r  \n\\#8:  Organising Committee Member, Sano Paila Community Rehabilitation Center & Greenway Nepal: Raised USD 1500 for girls in rural community schools, Provided First-aid training, cycle safety training and initiated art reform for the school.\r  \n\r  \n\\#9: Student Lab Assistant: Helped Peers and Juniors through accelerating their research projects by sample and chemical preparations, data recording and maintaining lab reports.

Pretty basic but I think it showed my desire for rigor.\n\n\\- Experiences: Talked about traveling and living in **Germany and Korea** and how it taught me cultural values and I then applied it to some academic accomplishments to show how they helped me\n\n\\- Future Education: Talked about why I'm interested in Biology and Engineering through anecdotes.\n\n\\- 3 Things About Me: My love of puzzles (briefly mentioned a traditional **Korean** game here), Performing/Composing/Listening to music from Classical to Pop, My interest in cooking which stemmed from living without my mom and becoming household chef\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Clearly there's kind of a pattern here...\n\nI know I was probably referred because my extracurriculars/honors aren't the best (lacking leadership and more national recognition/impact), but I just wanna know if I'm focusing too much on being both Korean and German. I am making sure to specifically state the different ways it has impacted me, but am I going overboard?\n\nThanks and Good Luck to everyone else !!!"

This is explained in additional info.\n\n\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Graphic Design Pathway, 8 APs (My school offers 11 and 2 of them are for CS pathway students), 12 Dual Enrollments, 7 honors. This is essentially the most rigorous courseload I could've possibly taken.\n\nSenior Year Course Load: AP Stats, AP Calc AB (school doesn't offer BC), AP Lit, AP Chem, 6 Dual enrollments, some random electives.\n\nStandardized Testing (Went Test Optional, explained in my additional info)\n\nOther (ex.

It is mostly recreational but I used to do some competitive(ish) sparring in freshman year and won some local youth awards. Got a green belt in my karate discipline (like the third highest belt). High commitment activity. I also got a lot of injuries through this and that is also explained on my app a little.\n\n\\#4 House Renovation Designer and Shadowing Mentee: Shadowed some architects, designers, and contractors for a house renovation. They tasked me with designing the bathroom specifically (with help) and I did that. Impactful as the project increased the value of the home by a couple of 10s of thousands of dollars.\n\n\\#5 Sales Associate Job to help the family financially in junior year: worked at a (large-scale) apparel store near me for more than half a year and met a lot of sales goals/records (impact) and I did some interior design for the store (spike!!). Also a high-commitment weekend activity.\n\n\\#6 Summer Studio Workshop Week at a local well-known state school for architecture: Was relatively selective and I designed a pavilion (conceptual) for a historic part of campus with a team and presented it to like 300+ experts, faculty and enthusiasts. Earned a merit award for my designs (but tbf a lot of people at the workshop got the award as well). Learned a notoriously difficult CAD program in like 2 days in and out (from many sleepless nights lol)\n\n\\#7 Did a fellowship with a sustainable non-profit against factory farming and I worked on content creation design where I researched and compiled information and turned it into infographics. Used them to do a webinar for the organization which reached some people internationally and presented it locally to kids as well.\n\n\\#8 Did a small internship with a national non-profit focused on sustainability in schools. Mostly did content creation design for their social media. Pioneered a series for their IG.\n\n\\#9 Multiple student organizations at school with leadership positions: Prominent leadership position on my school's student council (with a unique political system), President of my school's NHS \u2620\ufe0f, USED TO BE Secretary of a niche club that has influence at my school. Did a lot of fundraising and events for school, also did a lot of fundraising and donations for humanitarian/non-profit initiatives. Activities in this sector (along with a couple others with other students at school) got my entire school awarded a prestigious statewide public school honor.\n\n\\#10 TikTok Influencing \u2620\ufe0f: Literally did music (Rap) shitposts when I was a sophomore & junior. Started a micro-trend. Had to utilize graphic design for this. I worded it in a clever way in my app and weaved it into the music production experience I have. Stated the impact stats I had (reached like 100k+ people).\n\nAwards/Honors\n\nList all awards and honors submitted on your application.\n\n\\#1 Semi-Finalist in a Climate Science Olympiad (ONLINE & STILL ONGOING) idk if this one has much credibility because its a relatively less known olympiad. But they work with the UN.\n\n\\#2 Small $1000 Essay Writing Scholarship about sustainable architecture\n\n\\#3 Local state school (Highly Ranked for Architecture) merit award for studio design\n\n\\#4 Design Contest for my charter school system ad campaign, won the infographics section (Had to beat students from like 60+ schools statewide)\n\n\\#5 Regional Science Fair Placement in a Competitive Urban Area, Award from my school's local science fair for physics\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nPhysics Teacher: (8/10) Elaborated on the intersection of design/architecture along with me excelling in physics. Heard it was pretty good and very descriptive of who I am academically.\n\nSpanish Teacher: (9/10) She's chill and knows who I am (personality and values) so I'm assuming she probably spoke about that. She is also very funny and interesting so she probably writes like how she is.\n\nArchitectural Mentor (8/10??): She is a licensed architect who worked with me on some of my design projects and I assisted her with her graduate-level case studies and assignments. Mostly just spoke and validated my architectural experience.\n\nInterviews\n\nRice Interview: (???/10) idk I think I kinda vibed with her but I feel like she had mixed feelings. We bonded over Drake because I wrote an essay about him and she has an internship at a law firm that works with him lol.\n\nEssays\n\nCommon App: My personal statement was about my experiences in architecture starting with when I was a kid. I would create little homes for bugs as a kid and I spoke about that in a creative writing kinda way. Very vivid and descriptive. I think it showed my personality and mostly my values. Stressed the importance of architecture as a philosophy and sustainability as a way of life. Also connected it to some of my ECs and more off-application experiences.\n\nRice Essays (Reused them for a lot of schools as well)- For the \"Why Major\" I spoke about an experience I had with an artisanal furniture maker in a farmers market and how he taught me about how design can tell stories. Then I explained how the biggest form of design telling a story is what we are surrounded by: architecture. Then I connected my inspiration to Rice's architecture offerings.\n\n\\- For the \"Why Us\" started off speaking about Drake lol, and how the OVO logo looks like Rice's logo. I spoke about the kind of versatility Drake has as an artist and then connected it to the versatility of Rice. Connected it to my interdisciplinary interests grounded by architecture and connected myself to notable and less-notable but campus-famous alumni.\n\n\\- Why Architecture (Again?? lol) I spoke about how I was inspired by optics and aesthetics from focusing on a rainbow light-beam going through a water droplet once and how it led me to do an optics & light refraction project in architecture. Connected it to how I want to study the unique intersection of architecture and optics at Rice. Mentioned specific things I want to do at Rice with this interest.\n\n\\- Another Why Arch essay lol: I spoke about how my urban downtown hometown connected with me during an experience as a kid when I got lost in the big city and wandered around. I spoke about how each district I ventured through represented a part of me and how the architecture contributed to the identity of the area and my identity. Then I connected it to the diversity of Houston and Rice itself. Connected urban architecture communities to Rice's community overall.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAlso (for context to how competitive I may be as an applicant) I got into a bunch of fly-in programs at some liberal arts colleges. The best ones were like well-known LACs (think NESCAC, little 3 schools)\n\nAcceptances:\n\nI only got rolling decisions mostly so far.\n\n\\- Pratt Institute with partial merit scholarship (EA)\n\n\\- Texas A&M with partial merit scholarship (rolling) \n\n\\- University of Houston with partial merit scholarship (rolling) \n\n\\- Woodbury University with partial merit scholarship (rolling) \n\n\\- University of Kansas (Masters Program for high school graduates) with partial merit scholarship (EA rolling)\n\nIM WAITING FOR A LOT OF RD DECISIONS\n\nRejections:\n\nREJECTED ED AT RICE :(\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nPoured my heart into those essays and formed a theme in my app. ALSO, I had a portfolio that is a big deal in architecture admissions. I know that a portfolio is very very subjective but a typical architecture undergrad portfolio requests a variety of works (and little to no technical works) that show creative aptitude and spatial awareness. My portfolio wasn't too crazy (I've never had an art class or tutor before or any art background at all, just did some projects on the side for personal expression. My works ranged from studies to fine arts to photography and my mediums ranged from digital sculptures to paintings to graphite drawings to architectural photography. Determine from that what you will. Idk what went wrong for Rice but I want to get it fixed before I apply to my second top choice (Cornell). Drop some feedback and suggestions if possible. "

Talked about my active solutions agaist violence, and how this goal/mission came from the violence of what my customers have suffered, my uncles, what my mom have suffered, etc.\n\nI did the stanford interview in early november, and I guess I earned points in being genuine cuz I cried TWO TIMESSSSSSSS. \n\nAnyways, I love helping people with the application process, so if you need any guidance, just send a message!!"

Create monthly meeting videos for members, facilitate service projects, along with normal member responsibilities\n\n5. Student Council Representative (10, 12). Elected to represent the data science students. Typical StuCo stuff like school spirit, school events, etc.\n\n6. Spanish Honor Society (12, Secretary). Post updates about service opportunities for members\n\n7. Science National Honor Society/Science Club (11-12). Pretty much just a member but I helped with a lot of environmental projects\n\n8. National English Honor Society (10-12). Just a member\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nAll Region Band x3 (vague so I don\u2019t get doxxed)\n\nAll County Band 1st chair x2, 2nd chair\n\nNational Merit Semifinalist\n\nSocial Studies Department Award (top 2 in grade) + Rho Kappa\n\nAfrican American Recognition Award\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nidk how to rate these\n\nAP Lang teacher: I got a 98 in her class and a 5 on the AP exam. She made copies of my essays at the end of the year, presumably to use as future examples. We talked about band sometimes since she used to be in marching band. My final exam project was a book about data science (which I asked her to mention)\n\nAP Calc teacher: I got 100 in her class and a 5 on the AP exam. She\u2019s said I\u2019m one of the strongest math students she\u2019s ever had. However, we weren\u2019t that close, so idk how personal the letter was.\n\n**Interview**\n\nDuke (9/10): Went surprisingly well. We had very intellectual conversations about some of my data science projects. He seemed impressed by my commitment to band. I think the interview added context to my ECs (I said that I joined honor societies/beta club so that I could feel like I had a purpose by giving back through service hours)\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy personal statement was about how I became more confident and overcame past insecurities by becoming a leader in marching band. It\u2019s a pretty generic topic but I structured it uniquely (the setting is me conducting at a band competition and there are flashbacks of the journey throughout my life). I revised and finalized it well before the Duke deadline.\n\nMy supplements were much more rushed but I still put time into them. For \u201cWhy Duke\u201d I mentioned specific things about math, data science, band, and environmental offerings at Duke and how I would utilize them.\n\nMy \u201cIntellectual Experience\u201d supplement was about a data science project we had in class. I described the process in a way that showed my passion and incorporated reflection along the way.\n\nFor \u201cBeing Different\u201d I talked about my \u201cundefined identity\u201d of feeling like I don\u2019t have any labels (mostly being mixed-race with only one parent to raise me). The reflection was that not having any labels \u201copens me to new perspectives\u201d and makes me a \u201ccatalyst for unity.\u201d\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nDuke University (ED) -> committed\n\nClemson University (EA)\n\nUniversity of South Carolina (EA)\n\n*Waitlists/Rejections:* None (how)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI'm already getting impostor syndrome. I thought I\u2019d have almost no shot at a T20 since my extracurriculars are weak and not at all related to my major. I think my essays carried me (everyone who read them said they\u2019re really good), but my interview and/or LORs may have been strong too. I\u2019m so grateful I don\u2019t have to write 40+ RD essays though!"

Like I said, I'm trans, but I'm not technically out at school, just in a weird limbo since I do pass physically but I don't correct people who use female pronouns/my deadname, mostly for safety/comfort reasons (I live in GA after all). She was one of the teachers who picked up on my identity, but I didn't actually tell her. She did like me though and often left nice comments on my essays. If I had to guess I'd say 7/10?\n\nAP Calc Teacher: Had him for AB and BC. He never picked up on my identity but I didn't really care since he was funny. I'm pretty sure he thought I was lazy but toward the end of the year he seemed to like me more and I want to say I proved my work ethic to him by pulling myself together to get the A in BC. Maybe a 5/10 or a 6/10?\n\nFencing coach: He wrote my outside LOR and I think this was definitely my strongest LOR. I'm also not out to him (LOL) but I've always been one of his favorites since I don't goof off a lot. I'd also been working for him for \\~1yr prior to this letter and he'd never had any real complaints about me and always told me I was doing a good job. 9/10, maybe even 10/10.  \nInterviews  \nN/A  \nEssays  \nCommonapp: I wrote about the novel I wrote during high school and how the changes it went through reflected the changes I went through, mostly surrounding my trans identity and how living in a conservative immigrant family affected me coming to terms with myself. TBH I thought it was a banger and I guess the AOs did too? (9/10)\n\nJHU Supp: I was going to submit a different one since I didn't want to seem too one-note about being trans, but I ended up going with one about my mother's journey with therapy and how it helped her (somewhat) accept me. The friends I showed it to really liked it, so I submitted it. 9/10    \nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)  \nAcceptances:  \nJohns Hopkins University (ED) <-- ATTENDING!!!!  \nGeorgia Tech (EA1)\n\nKennesaw State University (Rolling, applied in early October)  \nWaitlists:  \n   University of Georgia (EA) (I forgot to submit my SAT scores through CB so they deferred me...)  \nRejections:  \nN/A\n\n  \nAdditional Information:  \nSo honestly I wasn't expecting much from JHU. I will disclose that I applied with no financial aid since my parents can pay for my tuition, and I know that's a position of privilege and financial security that not a lot of people have. Also I'm not super sure if my LGBT identity actually gave me a boost or not in the process, I've heard from some places that it does and some that it doesn't. I didn't participate in any queer activism or clubs like the GSA though.\n\nIf anyone who wants to apply JHU in the future wants to know more, feel free to PM me and I'd love to give advice and details about my app, within reason of course. Overall I feel so happy and free being done with this whole shitty process, and so lucky to be going to my dream school. "

It was decent and succinct, and my advisor said it was pretty standard so maybe 6.5/10 or 7/10? It's hard for me to guess... For my other recommenders; which were my FFA advisor, freshman & AP Bio teacher, and my AB Calc & Geometry teacher (check additional info for more context); I assume they were at a similar level for their letters of recs.\r\n\n**Interviews**\r\n\nNone, even though Cornell offers interviews, they are non-evaluative and given based on availability.\r  \n\r  \n\r**Essays**\r  \n\rTruth be told, I have no idea about the quality of my application. I spent maybe 40+ hours on Cornell's supplementals alone, but I'm also a slow writer. I got my advisor, counselor, and AP Lit teacher to read my essays and edit them, which they all did very minimally, saying I was a good writer. The friends who read my essays said the exact same thing, each having a different favorite essay when I asked. If they did put comments, I chose to disregard a good portion of them despite it being good advice because it messed with my flow... (sorry everyone, thank you for your support & help!!)\n\nI was also told that the essay I wrote for the university-wide writing prompt might put me at a disadvantage because it touched upon my Korean identity and connection, but I put my foot down and sent it anyway. It was a crowd-favorite with my friends too, so I like to believe I made the right choice. I think my biggest strengths were my sincerity and story-telling quality, which shines with Cornell's long supplementals. \n\nMy personal essay was over collaging and shame about having less, and how I found a way of finding my own happiness out of what I had without trying to ignore my feelings or reality.\n\nOverall for all my writing, maybe a 7/10?\r  \n\r  \n\r\r**Decisions** (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\r  \n\rAcceptances:\r\n\n* Cornell CALS ED (Committed!!)\n* Texas A&M University\n* University of North Texas\n\nWaitlists:\r\n\nNone\r\n\nRejections:\r\n\nNone\n\n**Additional Information:**\r\n\nBiological Sciences at CALS actually requires calculus, but with my schedule, it was basically impossible for me to take any calculus class at any level without dropping my other classes. I met with an admissions counselor for CALS to talk about my options and what my best step forward was, which was self-studying because my local cc had already closed enrollment, and I sent in the materials they wanted (a statement from me about my calculus situation, a letter from my counselor talking about the situation from the school's perspective because I originally had the class in the schedule but it was dissolved, and an optional letter from my calculus teacher verifying my ability and how I'm studying with the exact same material as I would have in class).\n\nI also take care of my younger siblings by making them meals and driving them places because my parents both work at really early (now late) hours, and that stops me from taking on certain extracurriculars because of the time commitment with making sure my siblings are watched at home.\n\n**Closing Note:**\n\nI'm honestly still in shock from opening my decision from Cornell. I've wanted to go to Cornell for so long, around 5 years now, and now I've touched the sun which I've had my hand outstretched for. I hope that younger me who was so full of despair can look upon me and find a little hope. It feels like I've used up all my luck for the rest of my life, but that can't be true because I still have all the people who are supporting me. \n\nThank you, and good luck to everyone else whether they're still on their college application journey or if they've already been accepted!! You're all going to do great things, and no matter what, you should be proud of the person you've become"

It is my dream to do division I gymnastics but opportunities are very scarce. I am going to pursue a quality education and college experience rather than settle for division II/III athletics.\n* Competed at the USA Gymnastics Junior Developmental Gymnastics Championships in May 2023 - placed 17th in the nation on parallel bars.\n* 25 hrs per week - 52 weeks per year\n   * To accommodate this schedule, I have had an abbreviated school schedule ever since I was in elementary school.

Him and I are very close and we talk every day. I always spent my lunches doing work in his room and exploring my knowledge and love for chemistry. He is my favorite teacher I've ever had. He said he had no trouble at all writing a letter and enjoyed doing so. 10/10\n* Second letter was from my AP Lang teacher. We had very insightful and interesting discussions in her class and had a lot of fun. I'm not entirely sure how the rec letter was but she said she was honored to write me a letter. 7-8/10?\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* I interviewed with a Rice senior back in November. I think it went very well. I handled myself well and communicated my interests in academics and Rice as a school. They say it's not supposed to affect your admissions, but if it does, I don't think I sold the bag on that. 8/10\n\n**Essays -** Probably the strongest part of my application\n\n* Common App - I wrote about how my gymnastics career taught me that it is more rewarding to pursue difficult tasks and to do them at a high level rather than pursue absolute perfection. Perfection is not an attainable end, but rather a ceaseless pursuit of improvement and progression which has shaped me into the hard-working and determined person I am today.\n* Rice Supplements - I was more than satisfied with how I answered the prompts. I won't go into detail but I would be shocked if I somehow found out that these, as well as my Common App, were the reasons for my rejection.\n\n**Decisions**\n\nI got the status update yesterday that I was outright rejected. Rice was my dream school and it feels really crappy that I didn't get in. I don't know what else I really could've done given my involvement in my sport and I wanted to post this to see what anyone else thinks. I know my SAT is a little lower than the average applicant but I couldn't imagine that's why I didn't get in.

        "post": "Hello,\n\nI got deferred. Yep. Sad man. When I submitted my application I had undiagnosed ADHD and was not getting treatment. Pretty much went through all of high school (and my life) with no treatment. However, I received a psychiatric diagnosis a couple days ago for ADHD and will be starting treatment and getting the proper IB (I'm an IB Diploma student) testing accommodations. Despite my ADHD, I have a 39/45 IB predicted (with 2 core points, could be 3 but school gives 2 by default) and my junior year grades in my IB courses were 7s for every class with one 6. And I think I'm hooked?!?!?! (Don't really know what that means). But, I've lived in 5 countries (one being the US) and unexpectedly moved to a whole new country for my senior year where I'm continuing the IB (living life on mega ultra hard mode) and my brother has autism and I have to watch him sometimes (neurodivergent ass family). How do you guys think this would affect my application? Possible REA acceptance (PLEASE)? My EC's are pretty good I might post them later but need to work on some essays right now and don't want to overthink my life on this subreddit. Any tips on approaching a LOCI?\n\nI think the testing accommodations could really help my grades, I lose a lot of grades because I rush / hypersensitive to some minor inconvenience around me (with testing accommodations i'd get my own room).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, I'm applying as a Government major and intending on doing a special concentration in Neuroscience (who would've guessed) as premed.

Long story short I had a long ass interview but I told my friend who was also applying which made him realize he also got an interview after checking his email, and then I walked into one of my other friends being interviewed while grabbing coffee but I literally was just like \u201cgood luck with your conversation!\u201d and minded my own business. I think that the culture around acceptances esp this year was very cutthroat minded but it definite does not have to be that way. My friend and cafe girl and I all got in so its definitely gonna work out the way its supposed to!*\n\n*For Juniors anxiously reading: I was in your shoes not long ago. I remember Junior spring I\u2019d cope by coming onto this sub and reading every acceptance to the point I had them memorized, but it\u2019s really not worth it to dedicate your entire life to just getting in. I had a lot of fun too at my summer programs, etc. and I pushed myself because I also enjoyed it. Do not force yourself to pursue things you don\u2019t feel excited about in the morning. After I submitted my applications I sat dumbfounded at my computer and thought- what now? That should NEVER have to be the case.* ***The world does NOT end when you\u2019re seventeen*** *and you just need to find hobbies to let the time flow by and breathe. I started running and DJ-ing and writing funny letterbox reviews I love it. Excited to take up more fun things to do soon too.*"

Got into a research program, joined a few clubs, brainstormed my essay for a year and edited it for about 5 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent all of high school constantly extremely stressed about college. It really seemed like I wouldn't get in anywhere, and now that I have it feels kind of anticlimactic. Now that the initial excitement of opening the letter is gone, I feel kind of disappointed in myself. I did poorly in every area throughout high school and ended up in an appropriate school with a minimal merit scholarship, even if I like it. "

This is really where my work ethic shined through, as I was able to catch up on a whole unit of precalc on my own and ace the final exam. I stayed after school every day to get her help and I think that really helped her see the best parts of me.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy personal essay is probably the thing that got me in. In my common app essay, I wrote about my struggle with my identity, being half Chinese and learning how to deal with cultural differences. I also talked about jumping from Mandarin 2 to Mandarin 5 in school and my experiences learning \"untold\" stories and gaining a new cultural perspective on China. Although the racial struggle is a common topic, I think how well-written the essay is is just as important as the topic.\n\nMy supplemental was about social justice and how I want to use psychology to help out in the justice system. It was pretty mid but they apparently liked it \ud83d\udc80\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* NYU ED1 (committed!!!)\n* ASU (rolling)\n* OSU (ea)\n* Penn state (rolling?)\n* MSU (ea)\n\nNo waitlists or rejections, I did apply to other schools but I'll never know since ed agreement\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nLooking back at my scores and grades, I definitely think my essay is what pulled me through. My unique experiences and drive to learn as well as my BU transcript really saved my guts. (And there's no denying that's probably one of two things that got me in, the other one being my Mandarin class\ud83d\ude2d)\nI made sure to make it evident in my essays that I was what NYU was looking for: a global citizen (with my multiracial background), someone who is talented and ambitious (I built my profile around language learning, psychology, and cultural differences) and isn't afraid to take on a challenge (average kid from boston spent 5 minutes on every email and clicked on every single link and even went to two campuses\ud83d\udc80)\nIf I have any words of advice, it's that grades definitely matter less than you think. Of course, you have to reach a certain benchmark to stand out initially (I have basically the 50th percentile for everything), but who you are is going to be the thing that gets you in."

It sucked bc my junior year, the teachers that liked me the most, I didn't necessarily do best in their class, as in on top of my student stuff. I'm more of a class clown in class as much as one can be at such a school, so yeah\n\nAlso submitted an outside one in like March just vouching for me more from a mentor.

Read to many Harvard essays that worked and thought it had to be at that level.  \nUltimately, didn't think it was that bad, but wasn't anything special. The topic was meh as well, I wrote about life lessons from poker, which looking back, isn't bad, but I probably should've used the 650 words to talk more about myself.  \nI think there was a lot of things I should've wrote about also to add validation sort of or to explain my background more. IDK tho\n\n  \n**Supplements**  \nI thought my supplements ended up being pretty effing good by the end. My early-round ones were definitely worse. The more I wrote, the more efficient and better I wrote.

I wasn't some standout econ/business applicant, but I definitely felt qualified. Unfortunately, I didn't have any hooks, and econ/business is a very popular major, so I don't stand out from the top econ applicants.  \nI really regret not exploring applying as other majors because that was a possibility for me. I could spin my application for applied math, physics, ChemE, PoliSci, really any of these areas bc I'd done such a variety of things. But I ended up procrastinating, trying to focus on schoolwork and it never really ended up being an option for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'll do takeaways later if I have time. Currently finals szn as I'm writing this. I've got a lot to say. Tbh, shoulda made this post during the summer or sometime way earlier. BTW, I was on the a2c,collegeresults, chanceme subs like since summer 21, which was my sophomore year. Spent way too much time jus reading and absorbing info, not actually doing stuff"

My school only offers like 5 APs, I took 4 of them (I didn't do AP Gov) and self-studied a few. Basically beyond max rigor, I took all honors and advanced classes offered except AP Gov in exchange for a study hall one semester. I used that study hall for Physics C(both) and Calc BC:  \n\n\n**AP:** Calculus BC\\*(5, AB Sub:5), Physics C (both)\\*(5,5), Chemistry (5), Biology (5), World History (5), Human Geography (5),  Statistics\\*(Pending). Environmental Sciences\\*(Pending), Computer Science A\\*(Pending), and English Lang\\*(Pending).  \n\n\n**IB Diploma:** \n\nHL: Math AA, Physics (first to do it in my school ever, I'm the only person in the class), English Lang & Lit, and History of the Americas\n\nSL: Biology, Environmental Sciences, and French  \n\n\nPredicted 7 for Math and Physics so far, not sure about rest. One of 2 students in the grade doing 4 HLs, and doing a 7th IB on top of the diploma (environmental sciences). Our school mandates English and History HL, and doesn't offer IBs for all of the subjects. I'm taking all the sciences available, and my Physics teacher was willing to offer me my own class for HL Physics.  \n\n\n**DE:** US Govt. and Economics  \nI also took Calc III and Linear Algebra at the Johns Hopkins Undergraduate Summer Term, and got a 4.0. I'm taking Real Analysis I and Differential Equations this coming summer of 2024.  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Awards:** National Merit Semifinalist, PVSA (2x), AIME Qualifier (114/150), School Department Physics Award (11th Grade), Department Math Award (10th Grade), UTA Calculus Bowl Finalist/ Team Captain, like 5 different national service awards, all the honor societies at my school, AP scholar, etc..\n\n\r\r  \n**Extracurriculars:** \n\n1. Summer Research Program at UT Austin, semi-selective, presented research on dark matter concentration in galactic clusters using the virial theorem and completed an intro astrophysics and data analysis course. Was credited for their FRI research course as well. First author and head of my research group.\n2. Paid Internship at a unicorn company from 10th-12th grade, around 15hrs/wk during school and 25 during breaks. Worked with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics content development for test products and spearheaded the development of certain textbooks that are being published.\n3. Published a 225 page textbook on AP Chemistry to amazon and Barnes and nobles, over 10000 lines of code in Latex . I'm the First Author, Illustrator, and Editor\n4. Research paper that's being pre-printed confirmed to be soon published to a semi-prestigious journal around December, basically a continuation of my work at UT Austin but expanded and more in-depth. I'm the first author and am working with 3 other people I met during the summer program.\n5. Co-founded a nonprofit org at my school where I teach in-person and online for around 4-6 hours per week and create content in the form of review books and packets online for Physics and Mathematics posted to the website. We have over 150 active members in our discord server and 12 student teachers for various subjects. I'm the vice president and also oversee the advanced math and physics department. I wrote part of my main essay about this\n6. I have an art, photography, and cinematography portfolio on a website I made online. There's about 5 short films (3-5 mins) and 4 landscape photography galleries each with 10-15 edited works. I use a drone for a lot of my footage. My art gallery is also pretty big (15-20 works) and I have some state level art awards on there. It's a compilation of some stuff before highschool as well, since I was about 11 years old. I'd like to think they're good, as some pieces took months to make.\n7. I'm part of the YMSL (young men's service league) for all 4 years of high school, have completed over 200 hours of service with them, and held a leadership position the whole time. I also lead bimonthly meetings and infomercials for younger members, and as a result of the connections I got from this, have a TON of volunteer hours with many other organizations (around 4 of which I had a significant impact in)\n8. I also volunteer at another org called GRACE, where I helped start some new programs and centers near my city. Lotsa service hours as well.\n9. Pre-College summer program at Duke in Particle Physics, did some research on the SuperCDMS particle detector\n10. I'm a paid tutor in Mathematics at a local business I co-founded, I work for roughly 1hr/wk and teach a range of students from elementary to high school.\n\r  \n\r  \n**Essays/LORs/Other:**  LOR for IB Math and Physics - 10, same teacher for both, was the top student in both classes and I worked with her to write the letter for a few months. She's also my extended essay supervisory and predicted me an A. My other LOR is from my AP Chem teacher (7/10), who should be fine since I wrote a textbook based on his class and method of teaching, and finally from my English teacher (8/10) who is known for writing great letters. I have an additional one from my employment, which was apparently a 10 from those who read it.\n\nI spent quite some time revising my Harvey Mudd essays, i think my common app main one and one of the supplementals are really good, while the other supplemental was somewhat good but not great.\n\r  \nI do not plan to ask for any financial aid.\n\n**Schools:** \nAccepted: \n- UT Austin (EA)\n- UTD (Full Ride)\n- Penn State\n- Harvey Mudd (ED1, Committed)\n- Georgia Tech \n- UIUC Grainger\n- Michigan Ann Arbor\n- CU Boulder w/ honors\n- UWisconsin Madison\n\nOther schools I was going to apply to if HMC didn't work out:\n\nRD: UCB, UCLA, UCSB, UCSD, UPenn, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, UChicago, Johns Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon, WashU St. Louis, MIT, and Caltech."

        "post": "Part 1 of update post from 2 years ago: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/v6bb61/update12_uc_results_from_a_local_californian_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nTwo years ago I applied to thirteen colleges as a freshman admit. I was waitlisted or rejected from the schools I wanted to go to (USC, UCLA, UC Irvine, UCSD, UC Berkeley, and others). I chose not to settle for Cal Poly SLO and went to community college. Here are my stats, be sure to scroll to the bottom for my results:\n\nDemographics\n\n\\- Gender: Female\n\n\\- Race/Ethnicity: Genetically Chinese, Culturally Malaysian-Chinese\n\n\\- Residence: Southern California\n\n\\- Income Bracket: Upper Middle Class\n\n\\- Type of School: Community College with a UCLA Honors Transfer TAP program and well established relationship with southern california universities. Strong Psych, Poli Sci, Biology, Chem, and Business programs.\n\nIntended Major(s): Public Health (or anything with a similar curriculum) doubling in Theater and Performance\n\nAcademics\n\n\\- GPA: 3.95\n\nExtracurriculars/Activities\n\n1. President of a chapter of a national community health organization that brought students, doctors, nurses, and emt's to Mexico to run free clinics\n2. Vice president of school's prelaw society\n3. Theater coursework and productions\n4. Completed pathway to law school (basically California LAW has a thing at community colleges where if you complete a pathway of coursework you get priority admissions to law schools in California)\n\nAwards/Honors\n\nList all awards and honors submitted on your application.\n\n1. Completed Honors Program\n2. Recieved Multiple Associates degrees in Political Science, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Liberal Studies, and Natural Sciences\n3. Scholarship\n4. Research conference prize\n5. Stanford research conference acceptance\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nI had two professors who I was close with write my letters of reccomendation. Both of which were phD holders.\n\nInterviews\n\nNever was called for any.\n\nEssays\n\nI really made a change in the way I approached these essays. I really tried to be as genuine as possible and reflect on what I did and why I was proud. I talked about where I was when I first applied to those colleges and how I learned to be more independent, self assured, and self validated. I talked about what I hoped to do with my degree and how I want to change the world with the knowledge I will gain at a university.\n\nI also did my fair share of pandering to schools by really researching their programs and really finding where I would fit in there. Schools are a lot more than reputation. Reputation is great and all but if you go to a highly ranked school that doesn't even have the major you want to pursue, then that's worse than going to a lower ranked college.\n\nI have really strong opinions on what essays should be about, if you want some tips check here: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/z5vh1r/heres_some_tips_for_piqs_and_ecs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nDecisions (hs result-> transfer result)\n\n\\- UCSD (waitlist -> accepted)\n\n\\- UCI (waitlist -> accepted)\n\n\\- UCLA (rejected -> accepted)\n\n\\- UC Berkeley (rejected -> accepted -> Committed)\n\n\\- USC (rejected -> accepted)\n\nWaitlists:\n\n\\- None\n\nRejections:\n\n\\- Columbia\n\n\\- Cornell (rejected -> rejected)\n\n\\- Harvard\n\n\\- John Hopkins\n\n\\- Brown\n\n\\- Yale (rejected -> rejected)\n\nThe rejection schools were never really my targets I just applied to see if I had a chance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI made part 1 of this post a year ago because I went through a really tough grieving process when I was rejected straight out of high school. I knew many people experienced the same thing and I wanted to sort of make a timeline here on the sub to prove to myself and others that it is possible to recover from a bad high school admissions cycle by going to community college. I have grown so much as a student and person by going there and I do not regret a second of it. To all the people who doubted me, I say this politely: screw you."

Model United Nations - I was Vice President my junior year and Underclassmen Youth Secretariat my sophomore year. I discussed how I routinely led conferences, trained our delegation, and prepared meeting slides. \n2.

English Tutoring and Mentorship - I am paired with Ukrainian students to help them improve their conversational English abilities; I also mentor new tutors for their first three months.\n4. Fellowship - I participated in an international relations/business fellowship, which involved monthly meetings and culminated in a service project.\n5. Public Library Volunteer - I was on two iterations of my public library system's Teen Advisory Board and assisted in the planning and execution of major service projects within the library. \n\n*My extracurriculars were honestly not good. Because of my family problems (including frequent hospitalizations for my mother), I was unable to participate in ECs as fully as I'd like.

Fellowship title (2022)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n1. **Counselor Recommendation:** My counselor was brand new. I met her two weeks before the school year started since my previous counselor (9-11) transitioned abruptly to a new position. I don't believe her letter was strong. She worked with my old counselor in drafting the letter based on my resume and my previous counselor's experiences with me.\n2. **AP European History/AP U.S. History Teacher:** I had him for AP U.S. and AP Euro the same year (junior year). I was one of the stronger students in class, plus (at the time) taking AP U.S. and AP Euro together was uncommon. He wrote a strong letter discussing my academic abilities, as well as my passion for history.\n3. **AP English Language Teacher:** I had her for AP English Language in my junior year, though she had known me since 9th grade (I participated on the debate team occasionally.) She talked about my personality mostly, from how I would help my classmates improve their writing outside of class, balance my personal life (including my mother's chronic illnesses), and \"resident Googler\" habits. I like to think her letter was good. \n\n**Essays**\n\n* **QuestBridge Personal Essay:** I wrote about how I used to be left out in my community, considering my family and I were an anomaly in my white, affluent suburb. I went to discuss how I would build LEGO spaceships in my room and talk to the stars, thinking I could find a sense of belonging and reunite with my family that I left behind before I was adopted (and how I want to find them) - this led to me developing a love for politics, and so on.\n* **QuestBridge Topical Essay:** I wrote about buying pho with my mom, and how it was my one lasting connection to my home country since I left too early to have solid memories. I tied this into my interest in studying history, specifically in East Asia, focusing on Western colonization, the Cold War, and lasting political influence.\n* **QuestBridge Short Answers:** In my first answer (\"greatest accomplishment\"), I discussed how I successfully led the revival of my school's annual Middle School MUN. For my second short answer (\"historical figure or fictional character\"), I wrote about a veterinarian I admired from the U.K. to ask him questions about ethics and morality.\n* **QuestBridge Short (Short) Responses:** I essentially hit on little pieces of my life, such as what I love to study, who makes me happy, what I want to do in college, etc. \n\n**QuestBridge Rankings**\n\n1.

These are all the activities that I put on my QuestBridge application. Of course, I elaborated more on these activities in my app, but I'm not really sure how AOs exactly reacted to my involvement. It's not the most traditionally competitive stuff (basically all of my activities are just hobbies), but I think I really did learn a lot from the stuff that I did.\n\n1. Some Graphic Design Stuff (4+ years): Made posters and whatnot.\n2. Video Game Modding (4+ years): I didn't do any programming lol; I was usually the team artist, alongside doing some other stuff. Made stuff some stuff solo and in teams.\n3. Home Cooking (4+ years): I ain't jokin', I spend a bit of time cooking and/or learning about cooking techniques, and I actually put that on my app.\n4. STEAM Club (2 years): STEM and Art Club. Didn't have any leadership positions lmao. I just vibed in there.\n5. 3D Modeling (4+ years): Self-taught Blender; made 3D models and textured those models; i.e, 3D art.\n\n* Fun fact, my mom specifically pressured me to join more clubs and be more involved in ECs, and I deliberately resisted her, lmao. My rationale was that I was never gonna get anything valuable out of doing stuff I really didn't wanna do, nor did I want to do the same things that everyone else was doing, so I did stuff at my own pace.\n\n**Awards:**\n\n* AP Scholar with Distinction\ud83d\udc80\n\n**Letters of Recommendation:**\n\n* I have no idea how good my LORs are honestly. I can estimate that they're probably pretty good, but obviously I don't know their exact contents or how they complimented the rest of my application.\n* Counselor recommendation: Honestly I think this is probably the best LOR I got; my counselor likes me and I was able to fill out my recommendation packet with some unique stuff for them for them to talk about. I'm not so presumptuous as to give a rating on my LOR quality tho.\n* Physics Teacher: I've had him as my Physics teacher for three whole years (Honors, AP 1, and AP C), and his class is the one where I'm most chill and myself (I've drawn all over his whiteboard multiple times with markers), so I think that he knows me the best out of all my teachers. I had some neat stuff happen in that class too. I've always done the best in his class too, so I think his evaluation probably best hit upon my academic ability.\n* AP Lang Teacher: He loved me ngl when I was in his class. I was able to express a lot of my ideas, personal philosophy, and personality outside of things like STEM and academics in his class, plus I've always crushed it whenever we had to do public speaking, like presentations and stuff in his class, so he probably had some nice things to write about me. Plus, I know for a fact that he thinks I'm smart (he said it out loud \ud83d\udc80).\n\n**Interviews:**\n\n* MIT Interview: My interviewer started out as a math major (or maybe it was applied math), but eventually found it too abstract/esoteric/whatever and somehow ended up as an Urban Planning Major (Course 11). You might've noticed that in my intended majors section up there, I listed Urban Planning as one of my intended majors, alongside Economics and Civil Engineering, so I was able to briefly talk about all three of those interests and tie them together (They're all super-interrelated disciplines, in fact, and interdisciplinary understanding was a big part of my application). I didn't actually know that she did Course 11 when I went into my interview even though she included that info in her email, so I went in blind. It worked out anyway tho lmao, since I was able to talk about those interests naturally.\n* Aside from my intended major, we talked about my background, my extracurricular involvement (She commented on the fact that most of my ECs were hobbies\ud83d\udc80; btw, for y'all doing MIT interviews in the future, you should try to highlight how you've worked in a team more than I did. Although, I do think that I was able to convey my enthusiasm for by hobbies well), and some other things. She attended MIT in like, the 70s, and so we somehow ended up talking about how MIT\u2014and society as a whole\u2014has changed since she attended, and she talked about how she worked with those huge computers that took up entire rooms, and how things are now. We also talked about the increased access to free information on the internet in the current information era, and she actually commented on how I was able to use that access to my benefit and learning by referencing my hobbies and EC involvement. We also somehow ended up talking about political polarization... and I somehow managed to comment on it by referencing the... recent stuff that's been going on in then news about Unis, and how I believe Universities should be a space for open dialogue.\n* We also talked about how I chose to apply to MIT, and how I generally went about the college application process in general, and what I wanted out of my college experience. By the end of my interview, I'm fairly sure that by the end of my interview, she said that, with my attitude, I would be able to succeed at any University.\n* Overall I think my interview was honestly a really influential part of my application, not by itself, but rather, as a supplement that complements the information that I shared in the rest of my application.\n\n**Essays:**\n\n* If I could isolate anything in particular as the thing that got me in, it would be my essays, but I really don't know.\n* QB Personal Statement: My first draft was *awful*, but I was able to salvage the main idea that I wanted to convey in that essay. I touched upon my immigrant background, other financial difficulties, family\u2014and ultimately, the main thing that my essay showed was a transformation of what I value in life. Not gonna lie, an immigrant story isn't the most unique topic out there, but I think I was able to really make it stand out by the way that I framed it and wrote it\u2014super personal. Ultimately, I really loved my QB Personal Statement. It was authentic and heartwarming, which is exactly what I wanted to accomplish with it.\n* QB Topical Essay: Wrote about STEAM (STEM with Art), through recounting an experience of me trying out some animation and eventually seeing how Physics and Math all tied into it. I also really love this essay. Overall, I think it highlighted my thought processes, persistence, curiosity, analysis and creativity\u2014and ultimately, I think it demonstrated a real, deep understanding of interdisciplinary learning, in this case, in the context of STEM and Art. Additionally, it also happened to explain and contextualize my extracurricular involvement.\n* \"Greatest Accomplishment\": I wrote about cooking fried chicken\ud83d\udc80. Overall, I think this essay reinforced the point I made about Science and Art in the previous essay, while also highlighting my process of problem solving, persistence, creativity, and adaptability, how I learn from others, and how I interact with my family. Of course there's also the implicit value statement in saying that perfecting a fried chicken recipe is my greatest accomplishment lmao.\n* \"Historical Figure\": I think I was able to highlight collaboration, teamwork, and knowledge of historical context. I was able to explain how my background motivates me to pursue my intended major (Civil Engineering), connect my historical figure to my immigrant background, while also connecting my major to my art related ECs.\n* Short Responses: I think I was able to convey small bits of my personality here and there that they couldn't get from the other essays; overall though, they were at least pretty fun to write. Also contextualized some other stuff.\n\nQuestBridge Rankings:\n\n1. MIT\n2. Stanford\n3. UPenn (Note: I only applied to M&T through the binding match agreement.)\n\n* As you can see, I was pretty ballsy by ranking only three colleges on my match list\u2014incredibly selective colleges too. It worked out though I suppose. My whole rationale was that I really didn't want to get bound to a school that I didn't actually 100% wanna go to, so I cut down my list to just three. I was banking on going insane with QuestBridge regular decision if the match didn't work out honestly. That's one of the main pieces of advice that past QB finalists have given me: QBRD > NCM because you have more freedom and ability to compare financial aid packages on top of that.\n\nDecisions:\n\n* *Acceptances:*\n   * Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): Accepted\n      * Through QuestBridge NCM, with a full ride.\n   * Local CSU: Accepted\n   * ASU: Accepted (Safeties \ud83d\udcaa)\n* MIT is the only non-binding college through the match, so I don't have to withdraw my other apps; I'm still waiting on the other schools I applied to lmao, though MIT is absolutely my no .1 choice. Other than MIT, I applied to 8 UCs, 6 CSUs, Stanford, Penn (Stanford and Penn automatically moved me to QBRD), and ASU. (Let the rejections and waitlists flood in over the next few months lmao).\n* I paid $460 for UC and CSU application fees 'cause the UC/CSU deadline was exactly one day before the QB decision date\ud83d\udc80. California admissions is honestly such a lottery that it got me scared enough to apply to so many more campuses than what the UC/CSU fee waivers cover\ud83d\udc80.\n\nNote:\n\nEven though I've faced a fair amount of hardships in my life, I don't think that's what got me in; other Questies have had more persistent and worse hardships (seriously, some of the stuff I've seen fellow Questies go through is insane) and they didn't necessarily get into their top choices, as sad as I am to witness it. Ultimately, I think the other stuff in my app is what ultimately carried me. With hardships in applications, I think this excerpt from *Write Your Way In,* by a former Duke AO explains it best:\n\n>Schools don't admit low-income applicants because they're poor; they admit them because these kids have found ways to succeed under challenging circumstances.\n\nAnother source, from Berkeley AOs on the subject of hardships: [https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/)\n\n>What we look for: Any unusual circumstances or hardships you have faced and the ways in which you have overcome or responded to them. Having a hardship is no guarantee of admission. If you choose to write about difficulties you have experienced, you should describe how you confronted and overcame your challenges, rather than describing a hardship just for the sake of including it in your application, and what you learned from or achieved in spite of these circumstances.  \n>  \n>*\\[In my application, I think I was really able to emphasize those bits, especially in the context of all the other stuff that I included with my application. That's how my hardships contributed to my candidacy, I think. In other words, describing my hardships and how I responded to them helped me because it complimented the rest of the information in my application and contributed to shaping my character and values\u2014not simply because I had hardships.\\]*\n\nFinal Reflection:\n\nI really didn't think that I'd match, but here I am now. So here's some final advice that I can give after analyzing my story.\n\n>Seriously though, you don't need to be cracked to get into college. You need to be sincere. Thoroughly show who you are and what things mean to you : how you've become the person that you are right now and what you've learned from your experiences. Colleges don't admit people for just what they did, but rather, for who they are. You want to show yourself as a person who can contribute to their community beyond the academics and awards: you want to show yourself as a person that other students would want to be friends with, learn from, and collaborate with; someone who does things because they want to do them, someone who does things for the right reasons ; someone with an open mind and critical thought\u2014ready to learn and contribute to the world, in small and big ways.  \n>  \n>So basically: ***Be yourself.*** It's not that hard.  \n>  \n>Even though people repeat that advice so much that it's become kinda cringy, AOs aren't lying when they say that.\n\nNow that I'm sitting here right now, I really do think that I applied sideways in my application\u2014so here's that good ol' blog post from MIT that explains that idea: [https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying\\_sideways/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/)\n\nAnother blog post: [https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-open-letter-to-mit-applicants/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-open-letter-to-mit-applicants/)\n\nHere's an excerpt from the book *Valedictorians at the Gate* by a former Dartmouth AO that adds some extra context about ECs too:\n\n>***Extracurricular interests matter because they shape a person, not because they strengthen a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.*** As a reviewer of extracurriculars, I can assure students that there is no magical formula, no perfect activity sequence, no guarantee that any r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will ensure a student\u2019s college admission. Instead, students who are active and engaged outside the classroom will remain competitive in the pool. They\u2019ll stand out for the context of their extracurriculars, rarely because of their extracurriculars. (I say rarely because the Oscar-nominated short film in a foreign language nominee is still going to catch our attention, provided, of course, her application is not otherwise terrible.)  \n>  \n>Best of all, students who participate in activities because they\u2019re interested might just become more interesting. They might become more curious community members. They might care about something other than r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. And they might become better people, not just better college applicants.\n\nThrough my college application process I went through far, far too many books, blog posts, and podcasts. Yet, there was one unescapable conclusion that I got from all of my sources\u2014be yourself. The application process isn't perfect. It definitely isn't. But under all the factors\u2014socioeconomic, academic, cultural, financial, whatever\u2014from what I can see, this still remains true: you're not gonna get admitted to a college by being the same as everyone else\u2014by being someone other than yourself. Embrace who you are, what makes you unique, the unique ways that you think about the world and your place in it, pursue what actually interests you, and learn from those experiences, do well in school, learn from others, teach others, be a good learner, a good friend, and a good person, and contribute to your community, either in big or small ways. That's all you need to do."

(YES I KNOW YOURE THERE, I WAS ONE OF YOU!) The best piece of advice I can give you is\u2026 just get off this sub, go out there, and try something new.

I thought would be able to get into at least one of the Ivy+ schools. It was when I got rejected from all UCs that my stats were not comparable to other applicants. Still, I was very fortunate to get accepted into some good CS schools like UMD and UT Austin.\n\nIt was actually hard to see myself getting rejected from more schools while my friends kept getting accepted. I still remember the shitty feeling I had when I saw the reaction video posted on Ig of my friend who got accepted to half Ivys. This was actually tough and stuck in my mind even after graduation. But, after I met many successful people in my country through the summer break, I realized that what makes these people different from normal people is the number of failures they've experienced. Probably, some of you reading my post won't get into your dream school. Don't feel bad about this. Every successful person experiences a very hard time in their life. The more you fail, the stronger you become. You can endure more difficult things that those who never fail cannot overcome.\n\nI've been at UT Austin for almost three months now. I cannot express enough how happy I am here. Everyone I met was super nice and I even made more friends than I did in my entire high school in this short time. The CS class I'm taking now (CS314: Data Structure) is very challenging but rewarding. At UT, I'm going to keep trying much harder than I was in high school. I know I'm gonna fail a lot but I can get over them.\n\nFinally, good luck with your college applications!  Any comments would be greatly appreciated!"

        "post": "I hope this post is inspiring for some people who may have been in the same situation as me. I considered myself a failure in high school, academically at least. I was lazy and unmotivated and had serious depression senior year, enough that I never turned in homework, didn't participate in activities, didn't apply for college or do much of anything that required effort. I eventually applied to a no-name school (no offense to it, its treated me well) that still had applications open in like March or April because it was easier than the thought of having to become an adult already. It was the only place I applied to and I got accepted because everyone does, so I began in Fall 2022.\n\nWhen I started university I turned my attitude around and started getting taking my education seriously. Three semesters of grinding later, and I have been accepted to transfer to my dream school, Georgia Tech, in Spring 2024.

I assumed my Questbridge Application would be strong enough for me to Match somewhere and the only thing I'd have to worry about in Winter Break would be senioritis. That absolutely was not the case.\n\nInstead, this college apps journey has been incredibly humbling but also validated my grind at the same time. There were so many ups and downs, but in my case, it worked out.\n\nI will say that despite the results of my Questbridge application, I have zero regrets about doing the Match, although I would alter my strategy slightly for the Match itself. For Questbridge hopefuls watching this, please do not get fixated on Matching with schools. Questbridge RD is an opportunity to not be overlooked (most of you will get into an amazing institution through RD) and so is the community around this program which has been nothing but amazing. I have a lot of reflections about Questbridge and plan to post more about them in the r/QuestBridge subreddit in the coming weeks.\n\nAn overarching thing about this process that applies to everyone applying is that so much of your college application hinges on the support system around you. I am incredibly grateful to have had supportive parents who were willing to spend time with me to work through this process. I am incredibly grateful to my counselor, teachers, and Matriculate advisors for helping me out tremendously in my development as a student and a person. I am incredibly thankful to have a friend group that always was in my corner but also kept me accountable.\n\n*Some thoughts:*\n\n* FINANCIAL AID IS SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE TIME TO DO. MAKE NOTE OF THIS.\n* Be wary of ED2 if you are a student who is going to rely on aid (and have leverage, aka Domestic students)\n* Don't underestimate this application process as easier than other countries that are based on exams. This process is its own beast.\n* Shotgunning applications is not a bad idea. Don't let the noise confuse you.\n* If you are doing QuestBridge, please apply to schools via other types of applications. Do not put all of your eggs in one basket.\n* Applying sideways is not invalid advice, but it has its limits.\n* Applying to get into certain types of colleges has its limits just like applying sideways (my advice is to do a bit of both).\n* Don't get attached to any institution until results come out.\n* Do not let a few unfortunate results hurt your confidence. Keep shooting, keep going. You got this dawg.\n* Find a good friend group that's there to support you (support them the same way too).\n* Showing your personality is key in your writing and presentation of yourself.\n* Understand a human is reading your application in a limited timeframe. Adjust your application accordingly.\n* Apply Honestly. (This is directed at my CS majors.) If you want CS, apply for CS. Don't try to mess around and apply as a different major with the intention of switching. If you get cold feet with committing to a major, go undeclared.\n* Celebrate. Every. Win. (I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.)\n* Also, don't let my results make you justify procrastinating. While I left nearly every application to the last minute, it wasn't without an established plan beforehand. The schools where I truly rawdogged the application in the final hour did not go well.\n\nThis Fall, I'm taking my talents to a place I've always had an admiration for (probably because a few of my closest friends have graduated or are in the school) but felt I wouldn't be a fit there because of the sheer size of the institution amongst some other factors. I am incredibly glad to have received the early notification from Cal, because it allowed me to really explore the university and helped me realize that I will belong here. I'm totally aware that EECS will be a hustle in terms of the work, but I'm up for the challenge and can't wait! Go Bears!!!\n\nNovember Update: It's almost been 3 months here. It's been nothing short of an experience. Who knew you can be academically challenged at an academically challenging school with one of the most academically challenging majors in this school?! The adjustment from high school to college is no joke. All I will say is to embrace change and not be so attached with immediate results. I have had to change my mindset and time management approach to maximize my time here both academically and socially. While not linear, I'm glad to be progressing and getting a grip of this place. Things have a really funny way of figuring itself out so let things play out. Cal was the place I needed and I'm glad I'm here.\n\nI want to end this long post with this: do not attribute your value to what happens in college admissions. This is a process where not a ton is under your control. The moment you send your application is the moment you let go of control over what happens. The decision is not in your hands. Treat it as such and embrace wherever you end up choosing. I've seen enough students at Cal not fully embrace their school and it's something that does nothing but hurt you. Embrace where you are and make the most of it. If there's one takeaway I want you to take, this should be that one thing."

Some background, I failed 1st semester of AP World and narrowly salvaged 2nd semester with a C. I had to retake both semesters of regular World History the Summer following Sophomore year to meet the World History requirements. I didn\u2019t take any of the AP exams because I was broke.\n\n**Extracurriculars**: The California Academic Decathlon was the direct extracurricular that transformed my life. I got registered in it my Junior year as it was the only class that fit my schedule, but I promptly found the mastership and fondness of communicating and discovered I adored talking and conveying ideas with others. I\u2019ll admit: my team did carry me. My peers were cracked in the top 10 of my class, but we made it through regional levels.\n\nCross Country, Track and Field. Varsity in both sports my Junior and Senior years, and qualified for CIF internationals.\n\nVolunteering. Hospital volunteering for in-stay patients to assist them in attending mass services on Sundays, and more church volunteering for a Catholic program my parents made me do. I became increasingly engaged at school around my Junior year with lots of after-school activities, food bank volunteering, community planning, and recreational activities, mainly activities where I helped better the city of Los Angeles. I completed around 1500+ hours of community service.\n\nCalifornia Scholarship Federation. I got accepted in my Junior year; this helped me get familiarized with community service opportunities and build more friendships.\n\n(Sort of) a business I ran at school. I\u2019m a foodie and love cooking. I make treats like dipped Strawberries, Apples, and Mexican treats and sold them around the school. I\u2019ve always held a skill for making and selling products and making quick cash, although it didn\u2019t make it an awful lot.\n\nPart-time work at a Downtown LA hotel. This is where I worked part-time during my Junior year and beyond to sustain my family with rent and utilities. I cooked meals for the buffet the hotel ran. It wasn't anything remarkable but I appreciated the work.\n\n**Schools I applied to**:\n\nCal State LA \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: English\n\nCal State Dominguez Hills \u2013 **Primary major**: Organizational Leadership. **Alternate major**: English (Literature)\n\nCal State Fullerton \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: English\n\nCal State Long Beach \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication (Organizational Comm). **Alternate major**: English (Rhetoric)\n\nSan Diego State University \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: Health Communication.\n\nCal Poly Pomona \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication (Organizational Comm). **Alternate major**: English (Literary Studies)\n\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: Agricultural Communication.\n\nUC Davis \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: Sociology (Organizational Studies)\n\nUC Santa Barbara \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: Language, Culture and Society\n\nUC San Diego \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: Literature/Writing\n\nUCLA \u2013 **Primary major**: Communication. **Alternate major**: English\n\nUC Berkeley \u2013 **Primary major**: Rhetoric. **Alternate major**: English\n\nBefore I share my college results, I want to share a f\u0336l\u0336e\u0336e\u0336t\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 synopsis of my life and the lengths I endured to get here. (I accidentally dragged this far too long. I guess I had a ton I wanted to speak. Feel free to skip the wall of text to my college results at the bottom if you'd prefer)\n\nI was a typical foo in the barrio with no goals in life. My older brother attended Cal State LA for Sociology and did Cross Country, Track, AVID, and Community Service during high school. I only began the same activities -- Cross Country, Track, and AVID -- as I held no goals. I loved playing violent video games. Smoking pot and cigars was a guilty pleasure and an escapade. I was arrested and booked as a juvenile a couple of times. All charges were dropped, yet I found myself spiraling into correctional facilities too often.\n\nCOVID wasn't any better. I was too lazy to complete homework. In my freshman year, I earned GPAs below 3.0 in both semesters, and I couldn\u2019t care less. I got B\u2019s in Cross and Track merely for skipping numerous practices. In my sophomore year, I earned a 2.17 GPA in my 1st semester, failed AP World with an F and Chemistry with a D. I was on probation for AVID and eligibility to continue in any sports. A significant incident transpired and I landed in a correctional facility for an entire week. My mom and dad were very concerned but I didn\u2019t care.\n\nWhen you\u2019re discursively described by politicians, public figures, and authorities as a purposeless soul and your life counts less than the richer residents just a few miles away and are directly personified as an inhumane gang member by just about everyone outside the barrio for your skin complexity, you're discouraged from believing you'd live past 16 years. This is why I had no goals at all. I had no connection with my older brother due to him attending college, deducing I would never reach his caliber. I evaded my parents chronically, exhausted from being compared to my brother. I was reticent, a socially inept foo who talked very little and had no friends.\n\nThe turning point I didn\u2019t recognize would\u2019ve completely transformed the watchtower of my future at that instant was my 2nd semester sophomore year. For AVID, we\u2019ve been accomplishing online tutorials (COVID lockdown) and I was always paired with this one dude to solve our Chemistry problems. He would bring up during the Zoom meetings how he noticed me during Track practice back in-person freshman year (I never noticed him, I tried my best to avoid people).\n\nOne day, he eagerly informed me he arranged in-person after-school running sessions with other Track members; socially distanced and wearing masks for accountability and reinforcement amongst the team. He asked me to join sometime. I was hesitant to join for weeks. Yet, I felt bored out of my mind playing video games all day, so I grabbed my running shoes and figured it wouldn't hurt running. I ran 5 miles that day with the group and slowly recognized running helped my psychological slate through a very doubtful period.\n\nHe invited me alongside other Track and Field friends to his home for lunch. In his room were dozens of sketches of math equations and physics posters. That\u2019s when I found out my now great friend was Valedictorian at the time and dreamed large as he sought to materialize monumental ideals. He humbly expressed his devotion to Engineering, taking high-level Physics courses at the Community College and competing in Physics invitations. This was a nuanced turning point: someone in the barrio like me taking command of his life and flourishing. To give you an idea of my great friend, I wouldn\u2019t see him often at school as he frequently traveled nationally and even outside the U.S. to compete in multiple Physics competitions, winning many awards. He made headlines for being the 1st person at our school to get into Princeton this March and just started there. My friend assisted in opening my eyes and admitting I'd been living very wrong.\n\nHe and my other friends from Track conveyed their anxieties about me smoking cigars and stealing. I was simply...existing...for no adequate reason. I didn't fit the narrative of my community anywhere and knew my life served no meaning for the longest time. For the 1st time, I felt like my life counted.\n\nWhen I had a question about my Geometry, Chemistry, or AP World homework, my friends wouldn\u2019t even think twice. They were quite patient with my slow intellect which I later uncovered as a blessing. It turns out AVID helped tremendously in familiarizing practical college preparation skills; I just never paid attention and took shortcuts. Same with Cross Country and Track. I would trim our daily runs or skip them altogether. It turns out I had a deficient running posture and throughout my sophomore year, my friends illustrated how to run appropriately and new breathing techniques. It was all uncomplicated, yet compulsory. I was on numerous probations and on the verge of flunking an entire semester. I came out the bottom with a 3.0 GPA 2nd semester, but it was sufficient to remain in AVID, any sports, and rescue myself before plunging too deep into the rabbit hole and repeating a semester.\n\nThat Summer, I asked all these questions discussing what electives to choose, how to study efficiently, and how to earn more money. My friends asked what my short and long-term goals were, my wildest dreams; all those good ice-breakers. I was mortified to acknowledge I didn\u2019t have any goals. They were part of numerous community service clubs: CSF, NHS, AVID Club, and Church. They said supporting the community supports your soul and I should tag along even if I'm not admitted as a member to these clubs for Junior year simply to volunteer.\n\nI wasn't allowed in AP US History after my AP World trauma. My great friend suggested to me AP Lang has been historically manageable at our school and I should enroll to develop my nomenclature and learning. That, coupled with the Academic Decathlon I was accidentally scheduled into was the largest coincidence to mankind ever. I quickly boasted my proficiency in the English language and widened myself to just how encouraged, goal-focused individuals live life. A Sacramento trip organized by the Decathlon where I competed was the 1st time I ever departed my bubble of Los Angeles. I was introduced to students from all over California and was humbled by all their dreams.\n\nI learned long-distance running was my specialty and ran Varsity for Cross and Track and Field. More importantly, I began getting closer to my brother and parents. My brother found victory working in Human Resources. He allowed me to open up regarding my enthusiasm to get into college and his profession. He earned enough money to invite me to nice dinners. He helped my parents with rent money (and still does). He introduced me to his friends and would all go travel to San Diego and Las Vegas, very fun times!\n\nI was rejected from NHS but accepted into CSF when I applied. I began diverging from my brother's life and forging my own path. I became a regular at numerous community service events all across Los Angeles. To visualize the discrepancies I launched in my own life: in my Junior year, I earned 3.29 and 3.71 GPAs respectively.\n\nSenior year, my friends were enthusiastic to pick my brain and decipher my career goals after turning my life downside-up. I responded with Communication! It\u2019s so mesmerizing just how distinct oral communication is from written communication; discovering from AP English Lang and Academic Decathlon. Confidence, rhetorical devices, and literature are all interesting to me, and their confluence with marketing. My brother would testify to how many people majoring in Communication entered the company he's in for Marketing research, using professional prose and expertness of the English lexicon to strategically design and disseminate advertisements. It was perfect! I enjoyed running my little food business. I'm likewise a major chatterbox and figured I might as well be prepared in the arts of communication to grow my extent to which I can professionally communicate.\n\nDuring my 1st week of senior year, I spoke with our school\u2019s college counselor for the 1st time. They inspected my transcript and told me I likely would be rejected from all colleges, even after my upward trend. They said I would see myself attending a Community College. If I preserve my upward trend, I may perhaps attend my local school, Cal State LA. I asked my smart amigo the exact questions I asked the college counselor and confessed everything the counselor advised was bull. He said I would\u2019ve likely gotten into Cal State LA due to local admissions criteria. He said Dominguez Hills was also local in this context and I should apply for the peace of mind (even if they didn\u2019t exactly offer my major choice). For the UCs, my friend was candid in admitting these universities have strict admissions criteria and I may as well just apply to those I was genuinely interested in.\n\nLikewise, my friend informed me it wouldn\u2019t hurt to apply to our local Community College anyhow as there was no commitment to attend immediately and the application only took roughly 20 minutes when he helped me apply on the spot. LA City College is a great Community College with many online courses, and it\u2019s not impossible to complete 2 years of work in a year as he\u2019s done tons of Community College coursework. I applied and was accepted way back in October.\n\nFor one, it was surreal to recognize I barely met the GPA threshold to apply for the UC\u2019s. I never once visualized earning the GPA to even be considered. My brother wasn\u2019t qualified for the UC\u2019s as a high school senior and applauded my determination to turn my life around, as my friends, teachers, and club advisors did similarly. That said, I predominantly centered the UC Personal Insight Questions around the very topics I\u2019m more or less communicating right now and heavily advocated for my upward trend and enthusiasm for Communication and English to motivate confident, well-articulated, and scholarly students from poverty backgrounds like me.\n\nMy friends did help revise and ghost write my essays as they picked my brain. Through their numerous revisions, I felt I best articulated my reflections and the faith I encompassed to live extraordinarily. I'm very grateful for their help, don't get me twisted. I just went with essays nobody viewed or helped edit but myself. I did receive an optional Letter of Recommendation invite for UC Berkeley after applying. I asked my Academic Decathlon and AP Literature teachers to write LORs in this case. Both have witnessed my personal gradient in real time and motivated me profoundly. One last thing, I am honored to say for my Senior year, I earned 4.0 unweighted and 4.29 weighted GPAs in both semesters. Unfortunately, none of this progress counted within the context of my college applications. Yet I was personally proud of my improvement and capability to tackle college coursework as a high school student and thrive in this environment.\n\n**My college results**:\n\nUC Davis \u2013 Rejected\n\nUC Santa Barbara \u2013 Rejected\n\nUC San Diego \u2013 Rejected\n\nUCLA \u2013 Rejected\n\nUC Berkeley \u2013 Rejected\n\nCal State LA \u2013 Accepted\n\nCal State Dominguez Hills \u2013 Accepted\n\nCal State Fullerton \u2013 Rejected\n\nCal State Long Beach \u2013 Rejected\n\nSan Diego State University \u2013 Rejected\n\nCal Poly Pomona \u2013 Rejected\n\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo \u2013 Accepted for my alternative major, Agricultural Communication.\n\n**An important note**: UC Berkeley was the last college result I received in late March. Roughly a week later, I received a spontaneous email from UC Merced stating that since I was (just) in the top 9% of my school class and got rejected from all the UCs, I was admitted to UC Merced for Sociology despite never applying lol.\n\nIt's now exactly a month since I began my studies at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo! I was intensely reluctant to commit here initially. It was a major change of environment and an opportunity I was very shocked at receiving. It\u2019s actually a major culture shock given few people at Cal Poly come from income levels like mine, or were admitted with low GPAs like mine. My friends personally drove me to visit the campus in April and I fell in love with everything! San Luis Obispo is a beautiful city with a strong community and prestigious programs. I did ultimately admit it would be wasteful to select Cal State LA or Dominguez Hills for the sake of emotional familiarity. Looking back, choosing comfort can be lethal in the pursuit of greatness, and I committed here under the foresight that I would build the stage to help other students in poverty reach success.\n\nTruthfully, Agricultural Communication is not exactly the program I envisioned. There\u2019s a lot of journalism involved. Journalism for farms, food companies, and animals. Although it\u2019s very niche and neat, I want to aim my sights at Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and Public Speaking and be someone who can enlighten and educate! I\u2019m looking to eventually change my majors into Economics, Agribusiness, or regular Communications. I'm not quite sure yet but we\u2019ll see what happens!\n\nI\u2019m an educated foo now and I wake up every morning in gratitude! I visit the beach often with my new friends, learning to surf and roller skate on the weekends, and appreciate dining at new restaurants in Downtown SLO. I went from believing I would die at a young age because many people in my community do, to educating myself in a great school and living in a wonderful city, so I know anyone and everyone can be great!\n\nDefinitely ask questions if you have any. I'll do my best to respond!"

I would also say that for the SAT really just understand time limits as well as do practice tests and just be confident going into the test. I would also say being $$$ is important to getting in thats the unfortunate reality of college admissions and a capitalistic society. Also wish maybe I applied to more selective schools you never know what could happen. Would also wanted to ask you guys why I got into NYU but not Fordham. Doesn't make sense to me.,,\n\n&#x200B;"

I\u2019ve seen a lot of conflicting views on what to put here, so I was pretty cautious about it. I think the right answer is just to put what you need, to help AOs get a clearer picture on who you are fully. This is how I formatted mine\u2013\\*italics are just comments for this post.\n\n**College Courses @ CMU**\n\nConcepts of Mathematics (*First year basically discrete mathematics course. A lot of fun, but super rigorous*)*:* A, 96%\n\nMethods of Statistics and Data Science (S*econd year stats course; it wasn\u2019t bad at all, and delved a bit into ML*)*:* A, 95%\n\n**Athletic Honors**\n\nAll-American 2nd Team, USA Fencing (11)\n\nAll-Academic 1st Team, Absolute Fencing (11)\n\n**AP/Merit Honors**\n\nAP Scholar with Distinction (12)\n\nNational Merit Semifinalist (12)\n\n**Additional Piano Honors**\n\n*I listed some other performances and awards here!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LORs (8/10):**\n\nI think that as a whole, these letters really helped solidify my application. A lot of the stuff I did was leadership based, and it wasn\u2019t really able to be quantified--the rec letters helped back up the amount of effort and time I had put into these activities, and I think they really helped my personality shine through my application.\n\nCS Teacher (9/10): I had him my freshman and sophomore years of high school\u2013super duper engaged in his class, he really helped catapult me to start some independent projects, and kept in touch later w/ a few more independent CS projects. Probably my favorite teacher that I\u2019ve had throughout HS.\n\nEnglish Teacher (6/10): I\u2019m not sure--I had heard he gives good recs, but only had him for one semester in AP Lang. I asked a lot of questions in class and talked to him a lot independently about writing and writing styles in general, out of class. I had a really weird writing phase my junior year of HS? Like a ton of purple prose, and weird emotional stuff? I think I was basically emo in 11th grade.\n\nMusic Teacher (8/10): I had been volunteering to play with his school ensembles since I was a freshman. He knows about my practice schedule and how big of a part music plays in my life (since I stayed every day after school to practice), and he knows me as a person pretty well.\n\nCoach (9/10): He\u2019s definitely seen the best side of me, and has seen my enthusiasm for fencing. Really looked up to him as a coach and friend\u2013has been there through 4 years of HS, and has seen me grow from a super quiet freshman to who I am now.\n\n**Common App Essay (9/10):**\n\nIt was  a stream-of-consciousness essay\u2013super romantic-era in style, talking about how this one moment fencing helped me stop seeing people as competition, but more as friends and others who shared my passion. Unlike a lot of the other styles I had seen online, I didn\u2019t just do an anecdote as a hook, and then go into like retrospective thinking--I just stayed in the anecdote for the entire essay. It felt really risky, because I knew for sure I didn\u2019t talk about my application as much as I should have--but it went really in depth to one part of my personality. Basically, the essay was 100% depth, 0% breadth.\n\nI was also very hesitant on this topic because I felt that the initial part of the essay (talking about how I saw others as competition) was really negative. However, I think it really showcased growth well, and touched on an important part of my personality--connecting and interacting with others.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT (0/10): SO BAD. This was my first interview as well and it was a pretty jarring experience. I kept answering questions, and he kept saying like. \u201cNo \u2026 that wasn\u2019t the answer I was looking for \u2026 try again?\u201d After that, I started talking about my CS projects, and he just absolutely drilled me. I talked about the algorithms I implemented in some of my projects, so on and so forth, and he kept quizzing me. I literally went back and studied my old projects again after this interview so I would be ready for the other interviewers?? (thankfully no one else quizzed me on the technicalities of my old projects again).\n\nWe had take a brief walk after, and talked about the weather for a while, so it also maybe made up for it? \ud83d\ude00\n\nHarvard (4/10): Pretty mid. The student actually went to the same school I did, but we didn\u2019t really connect on many fronts.\n\nYale (5/10): Pretty mid, but better than Harvard? It was just a typical interview, typical questions, and really straightforward.\n\nStanford (8/10): Good! My interviewer had actually seen some of my piano performances before! She was a super duper interesting person, and I really enjoyed talking to her.\n\nPrinceton (11/10): SO GOOD. My interviewer and I actually talked for 3-4 hours over Zoom, and just talked about really random experiences and times we had in our lives. We went like really in-depth about ourselves, and honestly, I think I connected with her more than I have with some of my friends. Super duper duper duper positive experience. Still in contact with my interviewer now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I applied to everything as a CS major (some under the arts college instead of the engineering college).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EA:**\n\nUT Austin (OOS): >!REJECTED. !<\n\nUIUC: >!REJECTED. A lot of my friends got in that day, so I was in genuine pain.!<\n\nUMich (OOS): >!Waitlisted. I heard they waitlisted a lot of OOS for EA, so I wasn\u2019t too worried.!<\n\nUVA: >!ACCEPTED! My good friend goes to this school, so I was really happy. Look up to her a lot too, so this made me excited to possibly go!!<\n\nGeorgia Tech (OOS): >!ACCEPTED! This was like two hours after UIUC so I recovered from my depression.!<\n\nYale (REA): >!Deferred. I was happy that I didn\u2019t get rejected though? I had a dream a few nights before that I got in, so I was \ud83d\ude4f that it would manifest. It did not. I think the biggest pain actually came from the fact I knew I needed to grind apps for like 3 more weeks throughout winter break :(!<\n\n**UC SCHOOLS:** I\u2019m guilty of just spamming UC. Really wanted Berkeley and UCLA, but thought might as well?\n\nUCSB: >!Accepted!<\n\nUCI: >!Accepted!<\n\nUCSD: >!Accepted!<\n\nUC Davis: >!Accepted!<\n\nUC Berkeley: >!Rejected!<\n\nUCLA:  >!Rejected!<\n\nThe irony.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RD:** I was coming into RD \u2026 not deathly afraid? but still pretty afraid. I had gotten into GT already, so if all didn\u2019t work out, I would still be able to go there (but I really really really didn\u2019t like the GT campus and the Southern weather\u2026). I knew that it shouldn\u2019t account too much into how one views where they\u2019re going, but I guess I didn\u2019t love the vibe there? I loved their THREADS curriculum though, so I was looking forward to it academically (for prospective GT applicants, I would recommend looking into this program)! I was really looking forward to a few schools. For Brown, I thought I would have a bit better than slim chance, since I submitted a video portfolio that I was personally super proud of. For Princeton, I was really hoping my interview would help carry through. For Yale, I was just praying.\n\nHarvard: >!Rejected. Childhood dreams gone :(!<\n\nMIT: >!Rejected!<\n\nUMich: >!Waitlisted. NOOOOOOOO SAD. I actually really loved UMich as a school and as a campus (its soooo pretty). This put me in my feels too :(!<\n\nNorthwestern: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nVanderbilt: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nBrown: >!Waitlisted. This was the first I had opened on Ivy Day. It was pretty crushing, since I thought that my personality was the best fit for Brown out of the rest of the schools. I didn\u2019t think I would have any more luck that night :/!<\n\nUPenn: >!Waitlisted. Also pain. I had a friend who I looked up to a lot who went here, and I really wanted to join him. Also, I love the campus? (ignoring the skyscrapers)!<\n\nPrinceton: >!Waitlisted.!<\n\nCornell: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nYale: >!ACCEPTED! Really surprised especially after my MID interview. !<\n\nDuke: >!ACCEPTED!!<\n\nCMU SCS: >!ACCEPTED! AAHH!!<\n\nStanford: >!I DID NOT BELIEVE THIS WHEN I OPENED IT. ACCEPTED \u2192 COMMITTED!!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\nThe college application process was brutal for me. There were a lot of restless nights, and a lot of anxiety and fear. I think my biggest mistake was making college apps my life--I really didn't talk to my friends much, and didn't really confide in anyone about my mental health. If I were to do it again, I'd definitely try to pace myself a bit more, and make it more sustainable.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s a few things that I think helped my application stand out. I think the first was my common app essay. It was a super risky essay though--I really took in the advice to show not tell, which is why I made it a stream-of-consciousness essay. Up till I submitted my application, I kept questioning the validity of the essay, and if it told enough about me and who I was to the AOs. At the end of EA, I yoloed it though? After more reflection for the RD round, I realized that this essay was pretty good\u2013it helped demonstrate more about my personality than if I were to directly comment on it (like how all the \u201cJHU Essays that Worked\u201d essays go). In retrospect, I would say to not be afraid to take risks. I would use my essays to show my personality, not the personality of the another essay I saw online. I think that everyone has different writing styles\u2013there aren\u2019t good and bad styles. There are just different styles.\n\nSecond, I organized my activity list in more of a category-grouping sort of way instead of how much time I spent on it, or how impressive I thought it sounded. So overall, it came out to be like\n\n(1-2) Piano\n\n(3-5) Fencing-related\n\n(6-10) More leadership\n\nOrganizing it like this helped me find out the main themes that I wanted in my application. For my activity list, I think including digital media production was sort of a unique thing? It definitely didn\u2019t really fit the gradient of the other activities listed. However, it was an activity that meant a lot to me, and so I included it. I personally think that it doesn't matter how impressive an activity is or how much time you spent--if it means a lot, I would put it in! Like, there are a few CS/DS related internships that I had done over the years that I opted out of including, because they didn't really have much of a personal impact on me, and grow my character. They would have most likely shown I was more qualified for CS , but I felt as it just didn't fit who I was as much as the other activities did. Finally, a few more comments.\n\n* I really don\u2019t think those big corporation college counselors are worth it. They not only try to manufacture \u201cpassion\u201d in your application, but their practices are just pretty ethically questionable in general. They are kinda scams too, for the price they\u2019re worth. I would talk to someone I trust,  close friends and teachers--they'll provide invaluable insight compared to some strangers that you hire!\n* I did a lot of self reflection! College apps was really about discovering who I am. I had to take a lot of time to figure out why I want to do what I want to do, and put my story on paper. It's very hard to put the human experience into words, which is why I think college apps is so hard sometimes.\n* I think AOs really do care about personality and initiative. Initiative is one of the biggest things I think that make applications stand out. If you see something in your community that needs fixing, take that initiative, no matter how big or how small. Genuine effort shows in your community as well as in an application.\n\nI spent a lot of time on this subreddit while I was applying, and after seeing so many applications, my biggest anxiety was not having a huge huge spike in STEM (no RSI, no ISEF). Uploading this application, I wanted to just show people applying that you don't need to always have a huge spike in some certain area--just be yourself, and you'll do good!"

Wrote about my journey in robotics, countless failures and always sticking with it to get to the point to I am now\n\nStanford: really good, spent the most time on these. Probably spent more time studying how to write them than actually writing\n\nUCs: pretty okay, definitely could\u2019ve been better but I\u2019m happy with them\n\nU Chicago: I think I had a pretty good \u2018Why Us\u2019 but the other prompt really messed me up\n\nHarvard: wrote all of them in literally 2 hours.

For mathletes, we had a meeting every other week for an hour or so, same with Science Bowl. I only ever prepared for Sci Oly about a week in advance, and I went pretty blind into Model UN other than a quick read through of the details of the conference. Most of my time was taken up by Taekwondo and Robotics, which were shown through my personal statement and supplementals.\n\nAnother thing to mention, the title is a little misleading. I was planning on applying to several safeties but after I got into Stanford REA I knew that was the school for me. I was actually planning on applying to around 20 schools, mostly reaches, but with some targets and safeties.\n\nI never really thought about colleges for most of high school. I found the things I liked a lot and went all in on them.\n\nThanks for reading!"

Although I did poorly in the class (finishing with a C+ one semester), I was confident she could speak on my **growth, character, and work-ethic.**\n\n2 - Economics Teacher (10/10) - Rating should explain itself - Knows me on a personal level and can speak heavily on my **work-ethic and personality.**\n\n**Interviews**\n\nDID NONE (was not confident enough to attend even though I was offered some)\n\nEssays\n\n**9.5/10, or even a 9.75.**\n\nI truly believe from the bottom of my heart that I wrote **absolutely spectacular essays.** Although I struggled heavily in STEM subjects like math and physics, I always had a knack for creative writing.\n\nHere was **MY GAMEPLAN:**\n\n1. I studied YouTube and Google **RELIGIOUSLY** (what made an essay brilliant? how did it make me feel?) - I was able to discover that individuals who were skilled at writing college application essays wrote in certain elegant and witty ways. They made basic human experiences seem so **authentic and revealing.** I watched SO MANY college essay videos and picked up on certain stylistic techniques. One of my favorite YouTubers during this time was Nicholas Chae.\n2. I spent countless hours in cafes writing essays for each school. I maybe went through **three or four drafts** for each question trying to perfect every little thing. I really enjoyed this process though, it was like perfecting an art piece.\n3. NOW FOR CONTENT - This is just my opinion, so please take it lightly. In the back of my mind, I knew I had one advantage. That advantage was creating a cohesive story with my application. I knew students in the same application pool had certain \"why's\" to their writing.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"why do you want to study business\" - countless applicants will mention how winning some business competition, or interning at X, or investing in X stock, or running some shoe-reselling business motivated them to explore business management or finance. I knew so many people showcasing themselves in this light.\n\nI decided to take the riskier route.\n\nRather than stressing my experience with business, I decided to tie my experiences with journalism, creative writing, and photography in order to bring together a story that showed my **unique motives and values** (while still hinting at my interest in business or economics of course).\n\nBy doing so, I believe I stood out from applicants with \"generic\" stories since I tied together a unique combination of hobbies and interests alongside my career interests.\n\nMy personal statement was a story about Play-Doh. I thought it was near-perfect.\n\nDecisions (not listing all of them)\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n**UC Berkeley (Out of State) - Accepted, Attending**\n\n**Northeastern University**\n\n**Arizona State University**\n\n**Purdue University**\n\n**Indiana University (Kelley)**\n\n**Penn State University**\n\n**Vanderbilt University**\n\n**Emory University**\n\n**University of Southern California (Marshall)**\n\nWaitlists:\n\nBabson College\n\nRejections:\n\nHarvard University\n\nYale University\n\nCornell University\n\nDartmouth College\n\nAmherst College\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nTufts University\n\n**UIUC (when I received this early rejection I thought it was time to pack things up lmfao)**\n\nBoston University\n\nBoston College\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\nNew York University\n\nUCLA/UCSD/UCSB\n\n**+ PLENTY MORE**\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nLet's discuss everything that was not in my favor:\n\n**1. Grades** \\- There was a brief period where I was legitimately depressed after looking at the average accepted GPA of the universities that I was interested in. Looking back, it was absolutely bizarre to think that someone with a 3.3 GPA could even break into a T-30 school at best. On top of all of this, the first semester of my junior year I received a 2.9 GPA with one C-. In total, there were four C's on my transcript. My school does not have a weighted GPA scale or rank, so my 3.3 is literally all I had to show\n\n**2. No Test Scores** \\- During COVID, scheduling for the SAT was the absolute worst. I was racing to somehow take this test since it only hurt me to not send a score since my grades were so low. However, the testing site cancelled last minute, and I had to face these T-20 schools with a 3.3.\n\n**3. Out of State** \\- Not sure if this is a big factor, but I am certain out of state applicants have some sort of disadvantage for UC's.\n\n**4. No Hooks**\n\n**How Did I Do It?**\n\n**1. Do Not Let the Noise Faze You** \\- I have vivid memories scrolling through chance me and feeling so horrible about my application. On my old reddit account, I asked a question pertaining to having a low GPA and was bombarded with responses like \"these schools will just filter your application out\". Although that is probably true for all the schools that rejected me, SOME SCHOOLS WILL TAKE THE CHANCE ON YOU.\n\n**2. By Being Unique** \\- I had an interesting spin to my application. Although I was interested in business, my extracurriculars, writing, and awards included many creative endeavors.\n\nBottom line, colleges care deeply about academics. It's the first thing they look at. It's evidence to predict if you will will excel in university. However, I realized that if you are someone with poor grades, you just have to carry that weight. Maybe if I put more effort into school I wouldn't have to put countless hours into writing.\n\n*However, I liked how it turned out.*"

I should have and would have done more engineering related ECs, but I honestly didn\u2019t know I was going to major in engineering until halfway through senior year first semester. A lot of these started in my junior year since Covid ruined a lot of opportunities for me and I didn\u2019t get to do as much as I wanted.\n\n1. **Volunteer at a hospital for children with special needs \\~ 2 years**I basically hung out with the patients, who were all kids with disabilities. Came up with some pretty basic activities, reading, drawing, arts and crafts. I also started a music program where I would bring a ukulele and play for the kids. It was a good experience for me, not only for just opening up perspective, but because up until that point I thought I wanted to be in the medical field, then I realized it was actually really exhausting and I wasn\u2019t as interested as I thought I was.\n2. **Piano teacher \\~ 1.5 years**I was a volunteer on an online organization that provided free education to children around the world. This one was pretty chill, I had to get creative on how to teach piano over Zoom.\n3. **Founded a small organization that teaches music for free \\~ 1 year**This was just something I decided to do because I figured I was already teaching piano, I might as well expand into music appreciation in general. It was actually pretty fun getting to gush about pop culture and nerding out over music. There were only maybe three kids who would attend. I taught some music theory and stuff but for the most part I would have them send in their favorite song/album, we\u2019d listen to it, and I\u2019d go into depth and do some musical analysis, as well as talk about cultural influences. For example, someone sent in The Low End Theory by A Tribe Called Quest and I got to blab about the origins of rap and how hip hop developed as a response to the economic conditions in Black communities, etc.\n4. **Music in general**I play like 4 instruments. I\u2019ve been in quite a few piano/cello recitals, which is pretty standard. I also did the US Open Music competition once for piano (though I didn't place anywhere lmao). I also took all the California Merit exams for piano by the time I was 14, skipping two levels and self studying the music theory portions. For funsies, I picked up the ukulele and the guitar and started a band with my friends, participated in Battle of the Bands. I didn\u2019t put this in my activities, but I also transcribe music sometimes.\n5. **Was an election poll worker**It was just a little summer job type of thing, show up for three days and work the entire day. It was honestly just a customer service job, but having experience with these types of things never hurt.\n6. **Church involvement**I\u2019m pretty involved in my church. I\u2019m the pianist, do a bit of hymn leading, participate in choir, lead arts and crafts activities and a bit of teaching there too.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nUC ELC thing, top %9 of classPresidential Volunteer Award but my dumbass forgot to put it down. That\u2019s it lmao. No other awards.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nI only needed one since I wasn\u2019t planning on applying to very selective schools.American Lit teacher - I honestly don\u2019t know how I would rank this. I didn\u2019t get to read it so I'm not sure what he put down. I wouldn\u2019t say we had a close relationship but we talked a few times, and he really liked my writing. In all the essays we wrote, I always got his feedback and got As. We had a few creative writing assignments and he always enjoyed mine. Lowkey, in my heart, I've always been a humanities girlie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nI genuinely think my essays were the reason I could even get into any decent school. They really let my personality shine through. I consider myself an introspective person and I was able to write out a lot of my thoughts that\u2019s been stirring around in my head for the past four years of my life. Reading them, you might be able to tell that I basically used like\u2026 3? 4? Experiences in my life and milked the hell out of it.\n\n**Common App - 9/10**\n\nI wrote about my experiences volunteering at the children\u2019s hospital. The main point of the essay was to show my curiosity, the way I observe things, how I form connections, and how I find solutions. For example, during the music program I lead, I met this boy who was deaf but could play the tambourine on beat, and had a surprisingly good sense of rhythm. I made a connection to what I learned in my physics class about how sound travels through vibrations. Through that I started getting curious about the human body, and basically jumped into a few rabbit holes involving topics like linguistics, audiology, etc. Then I connected that to how I make solutions to those questions, such as building something in my engineering class bc I was curious on how I could help with pollution I saw on the beach.\n\n**UC Essays - 8.5/10**\n\n* My passion and endeavors with music. Most of the stuff is already mentioned above, but more importantly how it\u2019s a universal language and brings people together regardless of background, how it\u2019s not about how good you can be at an instrument, but it\u2019s about that feeling of unity you get when you\u2019re playing together with other people. Self-expression and whatnot.\n* Wrote about how I created an automatic sieve that filters microplastics from sand as it spins in my engineering classes. It was challenging since I was pretty new to it all, and it was completely virtual (my team sucked and I did 99% of the work) This one was more about how I have a very strong sense of spatial awareness and was able to basically visualize everything in my head.\n* How much I love physics. This was honestly my weakest essay because it was lowkey BS, though I managed to spurn out something decent. I don\u2019t love physics all that much - hell, I didn\u2019t even take AP Physics. I chose physics as my topic because at the time I was writing this, I started settling on engineering and I knew I had to start molding my application into something related lol. It was less about physics itself, and more about how physics opened up other doors of science for me. Similar to my Common App tbh\n* My experience at the Children\u2019s Hospital, gaining new perspectives, contributing to the community, y\u2019all know how it is. Once again, a lot of it has been mentioned above.\n\n**Supplementals -**\n\nMost of it was just the UC essay about creating that filter in the engineering class and how I was interested in the school\u2019s programs of sustainability/green energy, or if the topic didn\u2019t apply I would use another UC essay. My UW essay was a combination of both Common App and UCs. Reuse, reduce, recycle lmao.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* San Jose State University\n* UC Merced\n* UC Riverside\n* UC Davis\n* Santa Clara University - EA\n* Calpoly Pomona\n* Calpoly\n* San Diego State\n* Penn State - EA\n* UIUC - EA (this was the most surprising!!!)\n* UCSC\n* Rowan University - EA for their BSMD program (I literally only applied because my mom was being delusional and she was so convinced that I would become a doctor)\n\nWaitlists:\n\n* Purdue - EA (Didn\u2019t sign up for waitlist)\n* UC San Diego - Rejected\n\nRejections:\n\n* UC Irvine (Aerospace)\n* UC Santa Barbara\n* UC Berkeley (Environmental Sciences)\n* UCLA (Materials Engineering)\n* UW\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little reflection:\n\nHonestly I was genuinely shocked by the fact I got into any UC or FREAKING UIUC for EE (!!) considering the fact I didn\u2019t take AP Calc BC or AP Physics. I only applied for funsies, just to toss my hat in the ring. I remember literally opening the portal while I was on the toilet and my jaw dropped.  Unfortunately they didn\u2019t give me any financial aid. $60,000 for one year is a lot and it\u2019s not worth it long term financially imo, but hey, if it was grad school it\u2019d be a much different story. Maybe it\u2019s the impostor syndrome speaking because I would hardly call EE my passion. I changed my mind last minute to this major so I kinda just got here without trying hard for it.\n\nMy top 3 I was deciding between was Davis, UIUC, or Santa Clara University. I was really considering SCU because it has very strong industry ties, they\u2019re very well funded, and they gave me enough financial aid where it was the same price as a UC. But I also live 10 minutes away from it and I wanted to be out of the house for my own character development. I felt like I wasn\u2019t appreciating what I had, and I needed to spend some time away from home so I could come back with a newfound appreciation.\n\nI ended up committing to UC Davis because it\u2019s far enough from home where I can be independent but I can also come back easily when I need to, and I like the vibe of the campus. It\u2019s not competitive, everyone\u2019s pretty laid back and friendly. Solid reputation, not as prestigious as UIUC but finding internships won\u2019t be terrible. It\u2019s boring in Sacramento, sure, but as an EE student I\u2019m probably going to be indoors a lot of the time.\n\nI have never been a very ambitious person. Sometimes I think about if I should have applied for more competitive schools and given the T20s a shot, but after visiting a lot of them, I had this really deep gut feeling that I just don\u2019t fit in with the campuses and the student body. I\u2019m not sure how to describe the feeling, but a wave of dread washed over me. Like I genuinely felt like I would go crazy or get depressed. It seemed a little too far away from me. I\u2019m happy with UC Davis."

We talked a bit about my interest in pure math and how I self-studied topology for fun.\n\nPrinceton (2/10): The guy was in really busy and had less than 20 minutes. Incredibly dry questions and responses.\n\nPenn (6/10): Generic but good\n\nYale (10/10): Damn. We talked for over 3 hours about poetry and metaphysics. (He was a philosophy major, and his mother a poet) At some point he teared up after hearing my common app story.

Brown was a close third, but only because the professor I worked with thought Brown lacked a bit of the hard rigor grad schools look for. Ultimately, I think VIPER swayed my choice to Penn due to the abundance of research opportunities. \n\nIn hindsight, maybe I could have stayed on the UChig/Columbia/Duke/Rice/NW/Cornell/Cal waitlists, but at the time I didn\u2019t bother since I liked Penn/Mudd/Brown more after revisits. Yale was a big bummer though. Sometimes I wonder if rea would have made the difference. Anyways, I'm not sure I would have even gone to Yale over Penn due to their primary focus being in the humanities. \n\nIt was also pretty funny that I was rejected by the top 5 schools for physics and only by those 5 schools. Nonetheless, I can\u2019t be happier about how things turned out, and I\u2019m very fortunate to receive the offers I did receive. \n\nIf you want to talk, feel free to dm!"

Junior Year Spanish honors teacher(100/10): Loved her, we bonded over being immigrants and lots of other things as well. Tried very hard in her class and only class I got an A in, lol. I knew her for all 4 years because she practically forced me to join the Latino American club at school since she was the supervisor. Also, she makes the best home cooked meals, and always brings them whenever we had meetings. We are still in contact, I'm so thankful to have had her.\n2. Junior year technology teacher(8/10): Great guy, super smart. We talked a lot about soccer and video games, since he was the supervisor for the video game club at my school. Participated a lot in his class. I was kind of loud in his class though, hope he didn't put that one down haha\ud83d\ude02\n\n**Interviews:** All of my interviews went well, I think I got along best with the IU interviewer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\n(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\n**Common App essay**: Obviously as you can see, soccer is very important to me. I wrote about a historic game in which my favorite club, Barcelona, was able to dramatically change its fortune within the span of 90 minutes. In Spain, it's known as la Remontada, and it even has its own wikipedia page: FC Barcelona 6-1 PSG.\n\nIt is hard to explain if you are not a soccer fan, but it was a game where a minimum 5 goal difference was needed to advance to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, which is practically impossible but miraculously it happened. When I watched this game at 12 years old, I saw how important it was to put faith in myself and in my dream, whenever I am on the pitch or laying in my bed at night. Because my family grew up poor, I was reminded everyday that no one can help myself, except myself. Starting where I am, doing what I can, and using what I can are the only tools that I have to achieve success, and it would be impossible without complete faith in myself and my actions.\n\nIn hindsight, I think using a soccer game was a little generic, but I literally could not think of anything else to write, and it's something I remember with a lot of emotion.\n\n**Why Us, and supplementals**: I tried to be as authentic as possible, and mainly gave reasons why a particular school would be a good fit for me. Though I may have exaggerated at times\ud83d\ude05\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* University of California, Riverside(RD)\n* Saint Louis University(RD)\n* University of Maryland(RD)\n* University of Virginia(RD)\n* Clemson University(RD)\n* University of New Mexico(RD)\n* Indiana University Bloomington(RD, committed!)\n* UCLA(RD, how????)\n\nWaitlists:\n\n\\--none\n\nRejections:\n\n* UC Berkeley(ED)\n* UMich(RD)\n\n**Additional Information:** Overall, surprised and delighted. Mostly shocked at the UCLA acceptance haha. Ultimately decided on Indiana as its known as a powerhouse among the D1 soccer universities and because of the reduced costs. My ultimate goal is to one day get drafted into the MLS or get offered a contract before my NCAA eligibility expires.\n\nIt goes without saying, but I am beyond grateful for the sacrifices my mother and father have made to get me here. My father who works like a dog, and my mom who cleans houses and has to put up with me, my brother, and my sister's bullshit all the time\ud83d\ude02. Also to my coach who rated me so highly, my friends who have supported me so much, and to God who has kept me in good health\ud83d\ude4f\n\nThank you for reading(also sorry, english is not my first language)"

I teach music theory and traditional Chinese music at a weekend school to kids. I get paid 25 dollars an hour, and I teach 2 hours a week.\n3. I made my own chamber orchestra group in 10th grade with 17 members of violins, cellos, violas, clarinets, and flutes. It was basically a group for people who felt underwhelmed since our county's music program wasn't very strong and was pretty overcrowded, so I wanted to make a group where there was some better management. I conduct for the group and occasionally play the piano for the group when the song we currently played needed one. We perform for charities, local events, and retirement homes. I have been personally been playing the piano for 11 years.\n4. I started a small rock band with 3 other friends. We mostly just play for fun on Friday evenings in my garage. I play the piano for the band. There is also a drummer, electric guitarist, and bassist.\n5. I have been playing the clarinet for 6 years. I am a part of my school's honor band as well as part of my city's orchestra. We put on 6 shows a year at a large theatre.\n6. I am the worship leader for my church, of which I play the piano for. I play on Fridays and Sundays for the youth and adult groups.\n7. I have conducted research into psychology 3 times during high school, and have been accepted into state and regional fairs.\n8.

Completed state program for medical shadowing & volunteering\n4. Principal's scholar award\n5. AP Scholar with Distinction\n\n**Commonapp -** I think I wrote my essay really well, I talked about how I played childhood pretend with my best friend, and how we would take our favorite videogames or cartoons and kind of change it up and integrate it into our pretend. I connected that to overcoming my slump in jazz band where I initially struggled with how to improvise, but when looking back, I got an idea that you could take influence from other works and play around with it to create your own improvisation. 8.5/10\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\nVCU Honors College (With Dean's Scholarship)\n\nVirginia Tech\n\nUVA with Echol's Scholar\n\nUniversity of Richmond (With full tuition scholarship)\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\nUNC Chapel Hill Honors College\n\nEmory University\n\nDuke (Deferred ---> Accepted!)\n\n\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\nVanderbilt University\n\n\n\n**Rejections:**\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nNorthwestern University\n\nBrown University\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nYale University\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI never really thought about college seriously until late Junior year, and in a way I think that helped me out a bit. I did activities that I was truly passionate about, and I think that was conveyed in my essays and descriptions of my extracurriculars. I am very grateful as a League of Legends degenerate to have the opportunity to choose between a full ride to University of Richmond or Duke. I know a lot of people say this, but for real, do the things you like, and you will end up in a nice place. I can't stress this enough, craft a narrative that emphasizes the uniqueness of your lived experiences. Also, if you get deferred, write a nice LOCI to the school. I wrote a 2 page LOCI to Duke, and I honestly think that it was the difference maker for getting in."

Principal - She is absolutely amazing. Worked with her all 4 years of high school due to my position in ASB & overall involvement in the school. She wrote my UC Berkeley LOR too, which I assume probably helped in my favor. She has a really great way with words and also has a very visionary-like mindset, so that definitely helped my application for sure.\n2. Calculus & Advanced Math College Professor - Super kindhearted person. Worked with her with my involvement in my DE's college & part time job (as well as in my classes) so she definitely had a lot of material to use regarding my character and similar. Not really sure what she wrote tbh but it had to have been pretty good LOL. (Also used her LOR for UC Berkeley).\n3. AP English teacher - Really lovely person who I feel like shares a similar mindset & personality with me, so she probably related to my behaviors and characteristics. I really did not participate much in her class as english is not my strong suit (+ I was going through it health wise the year I took her class), but I did try my best to involve myself in her class especially in the political and philosophical portions of the class. She also awarded me an outstanding achievement award for her class, so I'm assuming she had good things to write about me.\n4. AP Macro teacher - tbh to this day I don't know what he wrote about me and if it was good or bad. I always participated and did my best in his class, but it's hard to tell. He did write a nice letter to my parents at the end of fall semester about my achievement in the class, so maybe he wrote a really great LOR, who knows. Did not use this LOR as much as the first 2-3 just because I didn't know what to expect.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n*I truly believe no one bombed college interviews more than me. I was SO unprepared and was already naturally bad socially.*\n\n1. Bryn Mawr - My first interview, but it was at like 8am, and I was so tired. Managed to relate with the interviewer over our \"girl in STEM\" experiences, and I think I asked semi relevant questions (like Haverford students on campus, teaching styles, etc). But I do not think our conversation flowed AT ALL and it literally was me just grilling my interviewer with questions at the end. 5/10\n2. Princeton - My interviewer (who got her masters at Princeton) was really lovely but both her and I don't speak English as our first language (so we both had slight accents and grammar hiccups which caused the meeting to flow horribly). I was really unprepared (and not confident) discussing my research and involvement overall bc I felt like I was so underqualified compared to her. My questions were also not really relevant to her bc she didn't have the undergrad experience at Princeton, so all the questions I did ask her were so basic lmao. Also massive technical difficulties. I completely flopped. 1/10\n3. UPenn - Probably the most straight up interview I ever had. Interviewer literally asked why I didn't apply ED if I wanted to get into the Huntsman program & I (very stupidly) said that Cal is my top choice just financially. Told me I had 0 chance realistically, especially since I didn't have any formal education in my target language. We talked about our interests in slavic languages and econ (he was positively (?) surprised that I wasn't interested in straight up finance but more econ/data sci). tbh I had so many questions ab the Huntsman program so we spent most of the interview just talking about his experiences. 8/10\n4. Stanford - Most natural interview I had. Like Princeton, my interviewer also got her masters from Stanford so my questions were not the most relevant to her (and therefore I tripped up). But besides that, I think the interview was the most natural one because we genuinely went on tangents from so many different interview questions she had asked me. Overall, I really tried my hardest to tie every answer back to the essays I BS-ed in January. Because Stanford was such a reach, I didn't try on my essays and highly regretted that during interview session so I worked overtime during the interview LOL. 9.5/10 experience.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPIQ - long winded mathematical analogy that related to my ethnic identity (kind of tying in my interests in international relations/history & math/data sci)\n\nWhy Us Essays -  Did not research much about the schools & focused majority of the essay on me (and how the school kind of fit me). Made sure my why us essays were a bit on the quirkier side just because I hated why us essays.\n\nGeneral Supplementals Vibe - \"Quirky\" (semi cringe), usually filled with some sort of metaphor or literary device, creative, flowly language, focused on growth & tying everything together\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)** *in order of average acceptance rate*\n\n***Acceptances***: *including if I received any MERIT scholarship. most schools besides out of state public schools gave me some need based financial aid too*\n\n>Washington State (EA, Auto admit) w/ scholarship  \n>  \n>University of Oregon (EA) w/ scholarship  \n>  \n>SJSU w/ scholarship (RD)  \n>  \n>Santa Clara University (EA) w/ scholarship (almost full ride)  \n>  \n>UCSC (RD)  \n>  \n>University of Washington  (RD) w/ scholarship  \n>  \n>UC Davis (RD)  \n>  \n>CSU Long Beach (RD) w/ scholarship  \n>  \n>Bryn Mawr  (RD) w/ scholarship (max offer)  \n>  \n>Calpoly SLO (RD)  \n>  \n>UC Irvine (RD)  \n>  \n>UC Berkeley (RD)  \n>  \n>Wellesley College (RD)  \n>  \n>Northeastern (EA)  w/ scholarship  \n>  \n>UPenn Huntsman (Wharton + International Studies) (RD)  \n>  \n>Stanford (RD)\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\n>Smith College (RD)  \n>  \n>Reed College (RD)  \n>  \n>Carnegie Mellon (RD)  \n>  \n>UCLA (RD)  \n>  \n>Brown (RD)  \n>  \n>Princeton (RD)\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n>Williams College (RD)  \n>  \n>Swarthmore College (RD)  \n>  \n>UChicago (EA) *DO NOT* *DO UCHICAGO EA. It's literally a waste of your application fee.*\n\n*Honestly, I really don't know why I got in and others didn't, but I suppose if you shoot your shot, you might get lucky. In hindsight, I wish I applied to Harvard, because I loved Boston when I visited, but honestly, I probably wouldn't have gotten in LOL. Also, the LACs really didn't like me, it seems like, but I guess the idea of \"fit\" really is true cause most of the schools that rejected/waitlisted me have a similar feel versus those that didn't.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am super happy and grateful with how things turned out. Good luck to whoever is reading this & applying to college this round <33"

Photography account, amassed a decent following (nothing too crazy though)\n\n\n**Awards/Honors:**\n1. AP Scholar\n2. NHS\n3. Python Certification\n4. AutoCAD certification\n\n**Essays/LORs/Interviews:**\n\nWrote about how I\u2019ve been to 12 different schools and how a teacher helped me get out of my shell. Most of my essay focused on my development as a person and not my circumstances.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n* *Acceptances:* \n\n>! - ASU (Rolling, 16.5k/year scholarship) !<\n\n>! - Rose-Hulman (EA, 25k/year scholarship, cheapest option overall) !<\n\n>! - Drexel (EA, 20.4k/year scholarship) !<\n\n>! - CU Boulder (EA, 6.25k/year scholarship, got in undecided not CS) !<\n\n>! - Pitt (Rolling) !<\n\n>! - UMD (EA, L&S) !<\n\n>! - Northeastern (ED1, CS+Business, Boston Campus) **COMMITTED** !<\n\n* *Waitlists (counting deferrals too):*\n\n- >!

Grinnell (RD, didn\u2019t even know I applied, all I did was fill out some form on their site to get emails and apparently they counted it?) !<\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nHigh school was quite the ride for me. While ultimately I\u2019m not completely satisfied with myself (I probably never will), I do feel like I\u2019ve accomplished something I can be proud of. Sophomore and Junior year I was at my absolute lowest I\u2019ve ever been in life. Lonely, lazy, detached from reality, depressed (even suicidal), unsatisfied, fell into a massive gambling addiction, but also a selfish asshole. I\u2019m not sure what changed in me but instead of making excuses and coping through my delusions I got a sudden revelation that I needed to work to get what I wanted. I made changes to my life and it rewarded me in ways I couldn\u2019t imagine. I learnt what work ethic was, got a massive glow up (physically and mentally, at least this is what everyone tells me), wasn\u2019t obese anymore and even mildly muscular (still working on it), and got my life back on track. I still struggled in school but learnt to persevere instead of giving up and becoming depressed at the first sight of something going wrong. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not good enough or I\u2019ve wasted my potential but then I realize what I place I was at not even two years ago. It\u2019s easy to get lost comparing yourself to others (more so if you attend the most hated school on a2c) but please remind yourself that everyone is working on their own time and as long as you persevere and take care of yourself the world is yours to conquer and your time will come. This is just the beginning of a journey and instead of fear I new feel excitement about the future.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re wondering why my EA apps were still up when I should\u2019ve withdrawn NEU hadn\u2019t gotten my financial package out (SFS is straight ass) so I got extensions. Thankfully it came out my second cheapest option and NEU is cheaper than my state school despite me coming from an Upper-middle class family. People say NEU heavily favors Rich kids and that may be so but I\u2019ve seen so many low income or kids who got huge scholarships here (know people who turned down GT, Tufts, Cornell, UCLA, Berkeley, UW, and Georgetown for NEU) and know a ton of kids who are paying less for NEU than their state schools."

I was very close with both of them and did well in their classes, so hoping they were good!\n\n**Interviews**\n\nInterviewed at most schools I applied to, and most went very well. One exception, however, was my UPenn interview, as my interviewer unfortunately did not speak English \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Essays**\n\nIn my main essay, I discussed my journey of exploring my independence and becoming self-sufficient while battling against social dependency issues. In most of my supplements, I outlined my research history within and intentions to pursue the field of sexology, explaining how it differed from a traditional psychology degree and why I felt pursuing such an underdeveloped field was important.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nREA: Harvard University - Deferred - Waitlisted - Rejected (quite the ride indeed \ud83d\udc80)\n\n(Everything else was RD)\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n1.

Overall, my biggest advice to those about to apply to college is to establish a brand for yourself. It's up to you to show admissions officers how you differ from their other applicants; for me, I was fortunate enough to be pursuing a rare major, and I feel that did support my application. Good luck!"

I put my stats and EC\u2019s last year hoping for a read on my chances and everyone told me I had no shot at any of these schools. This proves that those people in r/chanceme are all high schoolers like you guys, they don\u2019t know any more than you do. \n\n2) There is no need to start a non-profit or something like that. It is important to understand that top colleges want a DIVERSE student body (not just in terms of race). They will NOT accept everyone who started a non-profit because then everyone at their school would have a non-profit. Spend your time on meaningful EC\u2019s, like I did. I had a friend, 2nd in the class, start a generic non-profit and did some good work, but that didn\u2019t allow them to spend much time on other EC\u2019s. They were rejected from most of the schools I applied to, but still got into Tufts, which is still really good, but yeah."

However, after mulling it over, I decided not to apply ED there (or anywhere for that matter) as I wanted to give myself options and the chance to go to an even better school that I had basically no shot at. After receiving my EA decisions, I didn't think I would have to commit to Michigan, as I thought something would hit RD. But, after receiving no acceptances RD, I was scared. I never really wanted to go to Michigan. It\u2019s cold, huge, far away, and has a big emphasis on greek life. I almost didn\u2019t even apply in the first place. But, after receiving the scholarship and visiting the campus, I fell in love, and was completely content with my decisions. When I got accepted off the waitlist at Cornell, the price was much lower and I knew I would be happier there. Although I would have absolutely loved UMich and would have been completely happy with how things worked out, Cornell was a no-brainer and I am very excited. Go Big Red!\n\nIn terms of my strength as an applicant, I\u2019m definitely subpar for T5 cs students. My extracurriculars and awards were especially lacking. However, I was able to weave all of my experiences into one cohesive story and general interest that made me stand out amongst a sea of cs applicants. My only advice is this: You are a unique person. Show it."

This choice was primarily driven by the availability of the IGETC program, which guarantees admission to any UC campus (excluding Berkeley and UCLA) and all CSU schools upon completion of the required courses with a GPA of 3.2 or higher. Moreover, the first two years of a Community College and University education are essentially equivalent in terms of General Education requirements. Opting for a University education would have entailed an annual cost of approximately $40,000, resulting in a total student debt of around $160,000. Conversely, attending a Community College for two years allows me to acquire the same knowledge for a mere $1,000, making it a financially wise decision before transferring to a four-year institution."

Not very impressive tbh but I liked it a lot\n2. *Technology Student Association* (10th - 12th) - did the same event all 3 years, was leadership (but did close to nothing) in 12th\n3. *Designed a website for a family friend* (11th)\n4. *Another summer program* (11th) - supposed to be an 'internship' but it wasn't really one, I just did a bit of Googling and made a presentation at the end\n5. *Math club* (9th - 12th) - helped run a couple of club activities in 11th and 12th but was not really that involved\n6. *Tutoring club* (11th - 12th) - somehow was leadership for this one in 12th even though it basically amounted to making slides\n7. *Piano* (9th - 12th) - played since 1st grade and won a couple of regional/state awards\n8. *Inspirit AI* (11th) - I regret putting this on here tbh but my parents insisted and I wasn't going to get involved in another argument :)\n9. *Dance* (9th) - had to quit because of the pandemic but I'd done it since kindergarten\n10. *Miscellaneous volunteering* (9th - 12th) - I have a pathetic amount of hours (like 50 *total*) and I think this hurt more than it helped\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. Sort of national math award 1 - \"high\" AMC score but I barely made the cutoff honestly\n2. TSA top 3 in state and nationals for a team event\n3. Sort of national math award 2 - \"high\" (in reality pretty low) AMC score again\n4. 3x AIME qualification - when applying early, I only had 2x AIME qualification\n5. Several school awards\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n*Counselor* \\- probably pretty standard. He knew who I was only because I was near the top of the class, and I've barely talked to him\n\n*Physics teacher* \\- had him junior year, I have a pretty good relationship with him, I'd say. I often stayed behind class to ask questions and stuff and I'm pretty sure he knew I put a lot of effort into understanding the material. The only bad thing is that I accidentally forgot to give him the info he'd requested for writing a letter until like two months before the EA deadline lol so um the letter probably didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped? That was definitely on me though.\n\n*English teacher* \\- I took this class a year early as a sophomore (most of the students were juniors) and online because of the pandemic, but I participated a lot and she knew who I was. She's also the advisor for one of the clubs I was a part of, and I occasionally helped her out as a (sort of) TA my junior and senior year.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n*(it's to be noted that I have the social skills and the personality of a wet piece of cardboard, so to put it lightly, I* suck *at interviews)*\n\nMIT (4-5/10) - average-ish. I definitely talked too fast and it was kind of awkward at times, but the guy was really nice.\n\nCornell (3/10) - thank god this was non-evaluative. It was *good* in that I walked out of the interview at least 3x more enthusiastic about Cornell than when I went in, but also I would've been absolutely fucked had he had anywhere to write stuff down about me because I ran out of questions to ask at the end.\n\nYale (6-7/10) - this was my only in-person interview. There was a little mishap with my emails not going through when scheduling it, but the interview itself probably went as smoothly as it could have for me. The guy was friendly, seemed interested in what I had to say, and basically at the end said that he hoped I'd choose Yale.\n\nStanford (3-4/10) - I'm like 90% sure my interviewer was trying to find something nice to say about me at the end to let me down easy lol. I think I revealed I wouldn't be a good fit for the school through my answers to her questions, though she of course was very nice about it all and didn't say so outright.\n\n**Essays**\n\n*(these were the bane of my existence for the latter half of summer and for the fall semester and I'm pretty sure it showed in my writing)*\n\nCommon App (5/10) - I'm desperately hoping this was average because I'm not even going to dare aim for \"good.\" It was about how I like to learn new things to better understand/appreciate the world. I think the concept definitely could've been executed better because the first part of it is insanely cringy/overdramatic and the last paragraph is also very dramatic and essentially hits the reader over the head with \"I love learning!!! It's amazing!!!\" Also, I only gave it to my English teacher to read over once and did all the other editing myself, so the writing quality might not be the best, either.\n\nSupplementals\n\n* In-state safeties/targets (4-5/10) - average to sort of not great. These were the first essays I wrote, and I did not spend much time on them at all. It shows.\n* CMU (4-5/10) - I liked the last essay (a modified, better version of my Viterbi diversity essay), but the first two were not it.\n* Cornell (6/10) - tbh I'm not even sure what a \"good\" why us essay even looks like anymore but while I cringed when writing this, upon rereading it's not so bad. I'd definitely say it's one of my better \"why us\" essays.\n* Duke (3-4/10) - my \"why us\" essay was probably average at best, and my optional supplementals were flaming hot garbage. I never want to reread them again.\n* Georgia Tech (5/10) - probably (hopefully?) average\n* MIT (5/10) - hoping for average. Some of them I liked, but since I spent so much time on them, I'm pretty sure I overedited. I want to cringe out of existence remembering the community contribution one though.\n* Stanford (7/10) - these were probably my best essays, ironically, but I'm going to be honest, that probably isn't saying much. My short answers were very average, if not downright cringy, but I really liked the longer essay prompts. I'm not going to reread my roommate essay to evaluate just how unhinged I sound though.\n* UIUC (2-3/10) - one of them was ok/average. The other one about goals or something was probably the shittiest, most empty thing I've written in my life, and I was a hairline fissure away from writing \"fuck this, just reject me already\" instead. It probably still would've been better than whatever I coughed up.\n* USC (6/10) - I spent a long time on the why USC one because I genuinely liked the school, and I think it's one of the better \"why us\" essays I wrote. The 14 grand challenge one was very meh. I'm not sure if what I wrote for the Viterbi diversity prompt was even applicable, but it was probably one of my favorite supplementals. I also spent a ridiculous amount of time on the short answers.\n* Yale (5/10) - the long, 400 word essay was *so* bad, I want to cry thinking about it. The other two plus the short answers I think were a lot better.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Local safety (EA)\n* In-state target/safety (EA)\n* Semi-selective state flagship (EA)\n* USC (EA defer -> accept -> committed!)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Cornell A&S (RD)\n* CMU (RD)\n* Duke (RD)\n* Georgia Tech (EA defer -> waitlist)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT (EA defer -> reject)\n* UIUC (EA)\n* Stanford (RD)\n* Yale (RD)\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nI added that I was a National Merit semifinalist + had a perfect score on AP CSP in the additional info section (yeah, I know, probably not the best use of it, but it's too late now). Plus I explained that I tried to continue dance on my own halfway through 10th grade, but had to stop because of limited space in my house.\n\n**Reflections/Thoughts**\n\nYou could not pay me enough to go through the process again. My mental health took a nosedive fall semester while I was trying to write essays, and half the reason why my supplementals document is so long is because I had several crying/rant sessions on there. I regret applying to some of the schools on my list - Stanford especially, it was a total waste of a $90 application fee - and definitely regret letting it essentially take over my life for the first half of senior year.\n\nI'm pretty happy with my results, though. I'd resigned myself to getting rejections from all my reaches, being the most generic and mediocre Asian CS applicant ever with questionable essays to boot, and so I was extremely surprised when I got into USC. My parents are probably more disappointed than I am lol, I'm just glad that it's all over. \n\nAnyhow, I'd definitely recommend applying early to a safety school with rolling decisions. It was a relief knowing before even submitting my early apps that I'd be going to *a* college, even if not one my parents would be entirely happy to settle for. And I know everyone says this time and time again, and it's so much easier said than done, but really, *don't* obsess as much as I did over the college app process - it's not worth it. Allow yourself to do fun things and give yourself grace during the process. Good luck to you all!"

I do think my essays were better for it. The one exception to that is surprisingly my only acceptance, which I threw on my list on impulse two days before the deadline. \n\n I'll be left forever thinking why Michigan was the only acceptance I got, but I'll probably never find out.

Sumer research with astrophysics post-doc working for NASA, learned some python and wrote a research paper on what I learned.\n2. Paid job working at local science museum (senior year)\n3. Paid job working at a bakery for a year (junior year)\n4. Volunteering at local hospital\n5. Leadership for my school's Asian affinity club\n6. Girls Who Code summer immersion program\n7. Founded school's chess club\n8. Stage managed for school plays in freshman year\n9. Math tutored outside of school and was a TA for Algebra 2 and Calc Honors\n10. Minecraft club (my only sophomore year EC lol)  \n\n\n**Awards/Honors:** National Merit Finalist, AP scholar or whatever  \n**Letters of Recommendation:**\n\n1. **Math teacher - 10/10:** My junior year calc honors teacher, we got along really well and his class made me love math. I got a 52% on my first test and he watched me improve to eventually get an A+ on the final. Very chilll guy, I was also apparently the only person he wrote a rec for lol.\n2. **Psychology teacher + advisor - 10/10:** Genuinely one of the nicest people ever. He supported me while I transitioned back into school and witnessed me grow more confident and motivated. Was super excited to write this rec and I'm really happy he did.  \n\n\n**Essays**: I spent a long time on my essays and I'd like to think they were decent. They were really specific and personal, but I made sure they didn't cross the line into trauma-dumping or oversharing. \n\n* used the additional info section to explain my absence from school and went over it with my college counselor from school. \n*  **topics/themes**: Finding confidence in STEM after not being a \"math/science person,\" moving to America from Asia in middle school, love for research, passion for astrophysics + math + education. learning to overcome challenge and how to ask for help, Asian affinity club at school\n\n   \n**Decisions:**  \n**Acceptances:**\n\n* CU Boulder (EA)\n* Harvey Mudd (ED2) -> committed :)\n* Reed (RD)\n* UC Santa Barbara, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz (RD)\n* Cal Poly SLO (RD)\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\n* Smith (RD)\n* UC Irvine, UC San Diego (RD)\n\n  \n**Rejections**:\n\n* Caltech (REA)\n* Pomona (RD)\n\n**Withdrew**: *After my ED2, I withdrew everywhere I could find the \"withdraw\" option on the portal LOL, so the RD decisions I got weren't just for ego I swear...*\n\n* Brown, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Northeastern, Whitman, Barnard, Occidental, \n* UMich (Deferred -> withdrew)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional info:** \n\nIn sophomore year I honestly didn't think I would graduate high school. I was struggling a lot with my mental and physical health and dealing with some grief stuff on top of it. I also hated online school and felt super isolated, so I turned to really bad self-destructive behavior and habits. \n\nI was sent back to the psych ward. It really sucked, I did really well in freshman yer and felt like I ruined it. They put me on different meds but it wasn't working and I kept acting out. My mom decided to send me away to a residential treatment program for over 50 days, and then a day program for the next 2 months. I had over 200 absences and missed the entire second semester of sophomore year. After getting out, I often felt hopeless and was so stressed about applying to college. \n\nI knew I wanted to study physics, and I initially was so set on Caltech (got into their fly in and loved it), but got rejected REA. I did more research and realized I really liked  liberal arts and slowly Harvey Mudd became my dream school. I didn't think I'd get in at all (no confidence esp. after rejection) but I ED2'd because why not. I was honest in my application and emphasized my growth rather than struggles. And I got in!!!\n\nAnyway, kind of a long story but just in case anyone here has (or knows someone who has) experienced similar setbacks: stay positive and hopeful. Never give up and remember how important balance is. I had to grind junior and senior year, but also, I took care of myself and asked for help when needed. I put my health and wellbeing first.\n\nAlso! Big credit to my mom and school for being so supportive throughout everything. I feel so lucky to have had the resources to get help, get clean, and focus on my academic passions again. I definitely wouldn't have made it here without the privilege of having a well-resourced parent and attending ga private school.  \n"

        "post": "Hey everyone, I'm Canadian and have wanted to study in the US (I want to live there afterward) since the 8th grade. I have been prepping for college admissions for years - it was a huge part of my life. I would spend hours weekly in the 8th and 9th grades watching college decision videos and spent 70-80 hours a week on ECs + school in grades 11 and 12 (60 hours/week in grades 9 and 10). I was dead set on going to the US for my professional path in entrepreneurship for animals, and the stress levels I subjected myself to were insane throughout high school. I was an absolute wreck during March, April, and May. \n\n**Demographics**: Female, white, public IB/regular split school in Ottawa area, no big hooks, Upper middle class (less than 200K/year in USD) but needed financial aid.\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: Biomedical engineering  \n**ACT/SAT/SAT II**: SAT: 1540 (math: 780, R&W: 760), 1 attempt summer before junior year, studied for 8 months\n\n**UW/W GPA and Rank**: In Canada, so averages are unweighted and out of 100%. My average for grade 9 was 92% (I was at a different school and they weighed averages based on the \"importance\" of the class - the most important was French, it was a French school, and I'm an anglophone). My average for grade 10 was \\~96% (current school) and my average for grade 11 was 98.25%. Average in November (EA) for grade 12 was 96%, in February 96.3%.\n\n**Coursework**: In the IB diploma program. *HLs*: English, Math AA, Physics, Chemistry. *SLs*: Spanish B, History. In February, predicted 7s for Spanish and Math, 6s for History, English, Chemistry, and 5 for Physics (92 on my report card, was my lowest grade). I took non-IB Biology as an elective in both years of IB and non-IB French as an elective in the first year (conflict with HL Math in year 2). I self-taught myself AP Bio in the 9th grade and got a 4. I self-taught myself AP Calc BC in the 10th grade and got a 5.\n\n**Awards**: CEMC Euclid 2022 and Cayley 2021 Certificate of Distinction, subject awards and academic awards from my school, finalist in a consulting challenge for the UNEP (United Nations Environmental Programme) - 4 teams were finalists out of 22, winning team (out of 7) in a consulting-style challenge for BenchSci, a drug discovery/AI startup  \n**Extracurriculars:** *at the time of application, the order might have been a bit different*   \nVeterinary Assistant (summer after grade 9 to grade 11)  \nResearch for a new canine chemotherapy treatment (independent since grade 6, wrote a proposal - not published, and got into a lab where I was learning the cell culture skills to test out my proposal)  \nWorking on a startup (just me) to reduce costs of veterinary diagnostics using AI (trying to develop a product, made an AI model for it based on human diagnostic data, was reaching out to vet clinics now to get veterinary data to actually make the product - also pitched my startup idea for this at a small local event and a small local competition) (grade 11 and 12)  \nConsulting Projects for the UNEP and BenchSci (grade 11)  \nWriter and Veterinary Review Team Coordinator for a small pet cancer organization (grades 9, 10, 11, 12)  \nWriting on Medium (published in some publications on the site) (grade 11)  \nTutor for math at my school (grade 11) + Math Help organizer at my school (grade 12)  \nLearning About and Developing Image Recognition AI Models (grade 11) - wrote articles on the models I coded and made videos too  \nShadowing Veterinarians (grade 9)  \nSchool journal (grade 9), Math Club (grade 9, 10, 11) & SAT Prep Club (grade 10)  \n**Essays**: *ratings are my opinion and from feedback from a free advisor my guidance counselor referred me to because she couldn't help as much*  \nPersonal statement: (9/10) wrote it about how my work as a veterinary assistant led me to start working on Lynx and the progress I'd made. Spent over a month writing it and found the length gave me more freedom for my writing style - I didn't feel the need to alter my writing voice. Had my advisor review it 3 (?) times. \n\nSupplemental essays: (5/10) my mom, advisor, and friends (who mostly applied to Canadian schools with few to no essays) said they were good, I thought they were horrible for most schools, good for Barnard, UChicago, Tufts, and maybe a few others.  I was comparing them to online examples and found mine boring. I'm not a very creative writer; I am a good writer for business and analysis/academic purposes, but I found it very hard to be \"quirky\" or creative with the supplements. I also wrote all my RD ones in like 2 weeks because IB (ahem physics) was getting insanely time-consuming, I spent 7-9 hours per school but I should have spent double that.   \n\n\n**LORs**: One from my history teacher and one from my chemistry teacher, they were my first choice teachers. I participated a lot in both of their classes. I also had another LOR from a mentor from an organization outside of school who got me interested in entrepreneurship/new tech. He's written them before, I had a much more personal connection to him than anyone at school. Saw the extra LOR (I'd say 8/10), did not see the teacher ones but my history teacher told me what he would write and I assume his was very good based on email exchanges etc. I believe my guidance counselor wrote me a good LOR since we'd been meeting every 1-2 months to discuss college apps since grade 10, and she told me she gave me the highest ratings on the CommonApp.  \n\n\n**Interviews**: *from what I can remember (might be missing some), ratings based on my opinion*  \n\n\nTufts, Stanford: (10/10) Both interviewers seemed to like me and indicated that I would be a good fit for the school. They also said they were impressed by my accomplishments and found the questions I asked \"interesting\" and \"good\". Tufts interviewer was also from Canada and a recent graduate, the Stanford interviewer graduated several decades ago, we talked about political climates and history a fair bit. \n\nUPenn: (9/10) Interviewer said I would be a good fit and seemed to like me, graduated in the early 2010s. \n\nHarvard, Columbia: (7/10) Were very average, didn't feel we connected much but our conversations were okay, they were both recent graduates (Harvard early 2010s, Columbia last semester). \n\nPrinceton, MIT: (4/10) These were bad. Interviewers seemed disinterested, Princeton interviewer kept asking about clubs and in-school commitments which I couldn't really speak to much since the things I was most passionate about were my startup, consulting work, and research. Both graduated several decades ago.  \n\n\n**Results**:\n\n*EA*: \n\n***Accepted***: Stony Brook WISE (with 1K/year scholarship), University of Buffalo (with 18K/year scholarship), Binghampton (with 10K/year scholarship) (*these were my \"safeties\"*)\n\n***Deferred***: MIT, UChicago, CWRU, USC (withdrew because I needed a scholarship to attend and they had no financial aid for internationals)  \n\n\n*RD*: \n\n***Accepted***: NYU (they gave me no financial aid)\n\n***Waitlisted***: CWRU, Tufts, Columbia\n\n***Rejected***: UChicago, MIT, JHU, Caltech, Stanford, Harvard, UPenn, Princeton, WashU, Barnard, Northwestern, Duke, Lehigh (this one stung since I drove 8 hours to visit them for demonstrated interest)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Waitlists and Advice**:\n\nI stayed on all waitlists and committed to Stony Brook. I sent upwards of 4 updates and LOCIs to each school. I had quite a few updates related to my startup (I got it incorporated, presented it at two small events, started discussing partnerships with other companies) and was also one of six students at my school nominated for validictorian (didn't win the vote but sent the update before voting started to say I was nominated and on the ballot). I also said I was straight in the EA round (and bi in the RD round) but came out as lesbian in February, so I casually mentioned this and how this has made the presence of an accepting community and resources for LGBTQ+ students important to me in my LOCIs. I was ultimately **rejected from Columbia and CWRU** and **got into Tufts** on June 5th with very generous financial aid that made it cheaper than SBU. I withdrew from SBU and enrolled at Tufts. I am SO thankful to my AO and to Tufts, as well as to all my recommenders and my advisor. \n\nMy main advice would be to finish your personal statement before grade 12 starts and spend at least 2 months (3 if applying to 15+ schools) on supplementals. If you're international, SHOTGUN APPLICATIONS. Around 10 non-American people at my school in IB applied to T50s in the US, but only I got in with financial aid (someone else got into NYU without aid, and someone got waitlisted at UPenn but then rejected, same thing for someone with Virginia Tech); I believe this was because I shotgunned. I know someone from another school in my city who got into UPenn, she also shotgunned. \n\nDon't underestimate the impact asking for aid has when international, but apply if you need it. You may think you will be able to figure out the money but my bank wouldn't even approve the amount in loans I wanted to take out when I was considering NYU without aid. The way I see it, the more schools you apply to, the greater the chance one thinks you're good enough to give you institutional aid. Could be wrong, this is just what I've seen.  \n\n\nHope this helps someone, and feel free to ask any questions in the comments/DMs :)"

MUN award\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI only had interviews for Princeton and Georgetown. I don't think they went well\u2014I'm a bit more introverted, and doing the interviews on Zoom didn't really help. I didn't really talk about my interests or extracurriculars as much as I felt I should have and didn't really convey that I was super passionate about the activities I do or what I want to pursue, even though I really am. But I definitely learned a lot from both experiences about interview skills and not being afraid to speak up! \n\n**Essays**\n\nI made sure my personal statement was completed before the school year started. I thought it really encapsulated who I was as a person. I showed a few people\u2014some really liked it, but others were kind of confused so I'm not really sure how to rate it lol. \n\nSome supplementals I spent a lot of time on, and others I did the day they were due. I ended up using the same structure for some of the essays and tweaked them based on the school and major I was applying to since a lot of the questions were quite similar. I ended up spending my whole winter break just working on supplementals. It was productive, but it wasn't fun. \n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* George Washington (RD)\n* Northeastern (EA)\n* College of William & Mary (RD - got a likely, but waitlisted from their joint degree international relations program with St. Andrews)\n* Fordham - Lincoln Center (EA)\n* Rutgers - New Brunswick (EA - honors program, not honors college lolz)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Carnegie Mellon (RD)\n* Boston College (RD)\n* Boston University (RD)\n* American (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Princeton (RD)\n* Harvard (RD - literally applied a minute before the deadline because I realized I could just reuse some of my supplementals XD ) \n* Georgetown (REA-->deferred-->rejected)\n* Tufts (RD)\n* NYU (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nDepending on the school, I either I applied for international relations or international business. If I could start this whole process over again, I wish I thought more about applying just for international relations or political science rather than international business. I didn't realize just how competitive some business programs were until after I applied\u2014I'm not sure if these results would be any different if I hadn't applied for these colleges' business schools. \n\nAlso, try not to have a dream school! I know it's a lot easier said than done, but I really didn't have a dream school throughout this whole process and it made it A LOT easier. In Spiderman: *No Way Home* MJ said \"If you expect disappointment, then you can never really get disappointed.\" And I think I took that mindset to heart. I loved all my safeties and even today would be okay if I ended up having to attend one of my safeties this fall. Throughout the process, I was super grateful for all the schools I got into, and doing research on them and my intended major really made me like them even more. While I might not be attending a T20 or T30, I'm still super happy with my final decision!"

I took Phys C as a junior which was a bit unusual at my school, but I wanted to do physics before chemistry because A. I was more interested in it and B. I thought it would look better on applications (even though it probably didn\u2019t matter). I was really confident and social in his class so I think he really liked me to begin with, and I used to stay after class sometimes asking questions about some of the concepts I was interested in. He asked me to TA for him my senior year and I already wanted to do that so it worked out really well. When this school year ended he literally gave me a gift card for my help and said I was the best TA he\u2019s ever had (I literally started bawling after he said that). To top it off I got the Physics Achievement Award for my grade which is meant to be for the top student of that department.\n\n**Calc BC Teacher 10/10:** My calc teacher is pretty much at the same level as my physics teacher. I was really social in his class and loved helping out with problems that were on the board (which was probably annoying for most people though haha). I did really well in his class and everytime he would pass back test scores he would always try acting surprised and it got to the point where he would only call on me with a funny voice. After APs he even put on 3Blue1Brown videos, and who doesn\u2019t love 3B1B? Even though I wasn\u2019t his TA this year he often came up to me asking to tutor some of the students in his class LOL. I also got the Math Achievement Award from him as well! (Although this award included 6 other students).\n\n**English Teacher 7/10**: I really loved my English teacher for junior year, although I now wish I could\u2019ve had my senior year English teacher write my LOR. Regardless, I loved my English class and tried to be as active as possible in class. I don\u2019t think she liked my humor as much as my math or physics teacher did, but she was a really cool teacher regardless. When I asked her to write a LOR for me she seemed really excited to do so and even mentioned a few funny stories that had happened in class regarding myself, so I think she wrote something pretty good \ud83d\ude42\n\n**Interviews**\n\n**MIT 4/10:** This was my first ever interview for college and it was also my dream school so I was SO nervous. I practiced a lot beforehand about what questions would be asked and whatnot but the guy who interviewed my went completely off-script and started just talking about his start-up company that he was building \ud83d\ude23. Apparently this was his first-ever time interviewing someone and he was also in a rush so I forgot to mention a lot of the things on my application (like my internships) and instead just went on about water polo??? At one point he just started asking about what classes his daughter should take when she became a freshman at my school?? He was also like a complete frat kid at MIT and I was not expecting that, so we didn\u2019t really mesh that well.\n\n**Stanford 7/10**: I think my Stanford interview went much better, but nothing to write home about. She and I talked a lot about music and how I\u2019ve been playing guitar for a long time. We also spoke about interesting classes that she took while in undergrad and we even had a cool conversation about cybersecurity and some of the lessons that I discussed in that club.\n\n**Harvard 6/10:** Harvard was my last actual interview (not counting Cornell because that didn\u2019t affect admissions) and I felt the most confident going into it. We met at a different place than where I did my first two interviews, but otherwise I was comfortable talking to him and we both had a lot of similar interests in cyber and engineering. Thing is\u2026I like cybersecurity but I don\u2019t want to major in it, and this guy worked at the biggest cyber company for 20 YEARS. So he started talking about a lot of things I just honestly didn\u2019t know and I felt kind of stupid. He also was like, \u201cyou should just not worry too much about admissions\u201d which felt like a pretty obvious \u201cyeah I'm not recommending you\u201d vibe to me.\n\n**Essays**\n\n**Personal Statement 7/10:** I personally felt like my main statement was pretty good and unique, cause I talked about a nickname I was given when I was younger and how that shaped who I was and wanted to become. I worked on it for a looong time, maybe like 3 months, so I felt like it was really polished and all that. However, I showed it to some of my friends after application seasons were over and they had mixed reviews, so maybe my personal bias got the best of me.\n\n**UCs 9/10**: These were my favorite essays. I actually did my UC essays the first, because I really appreciated how these schools just wanted very clear and concise essays about normal topics. I didn\u2019t have to double think what I was writing that often, and these essays actually acted as very good templates for my other essays that I had to write. The four topics that I selected were Leadership, Educational Opportunity, Academic Subject, and Community. I wrote about Cybersecurity and Model UN for the first one, my summer internship for the second, my interest in electrical engineering and mechatronics for the third, and my tutoring club for the last.\n\n**MIT App 8/10:** The MIT portal had like 20 essays to write which was just insane, but they were short enough that I didn\u2019t feel too stressed out writing them. I think I did my best trying to add some personality to these essays, because I found that that\u2019s what would help me stand out. I was pretty much able to write about everything in my application, and even a little bit about my jewish identity.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n>!Cal Poly Pomona (RD)!<\n\n>!Cal Poly SLO (RD)!<\n\n>!CU Boulder (EA)!<\n\n>!University of Washington (RD)!<\n\n>!UW Madison (RD)!<\n\n>!RPI (RD)!<\n\n>!USC + full tuition (EA)!<\n\n>!Cornell (RD)!<\n\n>!CMU SCS (RD) (Actually was so shocked with this one)!<\n\n>!UCLA + ECE Fast Track Program (RD)!<\n\n>!UC Berkeley EECS + Regents (RD) \u2192 Attending!!!!!<\n\n**Waitlists:**\n\n>!UMich \u2192 Withdrew!<\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n>!MIT (deferred \u2192 rejected)!<\n\n>!Harvard!<\n\n>!UPenn!<\n\n>!Colombia!<\n\n>!Stanford!<\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI am honestly so happy with my college decisions. For some reason I had dreams of going to MIT because I had just heard so many amazing things about it, but not going to lie, my interview with the MIT alum made me realize that it\u2019s still like any other school that has its own imperfections. When it came down to making a decision, I was really torn between Cornell, Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon, because all three have amazing programs. I think I decided not to go to Cornell because it just seemed like too big of a jump for me coming from sunny California, and personally I found CMU and Berkeley\u2019s programs better. Between CMU and Berkeley was much harder, but getting Regents along with EECS at Berkeley was a huge factor since a lot of the usual problems at a large public school like UCB go away with Regents.\n\nNow I guess the interesting part: I\u2019m trans. I\u2019ve known since I was a freshman in highschool (and probably felt it since I was born). I told my parents about it by the end of my freshman year, but received mixed support. My mom has been somewhat supportive about me transitioning, but my dad is completely against anything of the sort and will actively invade my privacy to make sure I\u2019m not doing any of that \u201cgay stuff\u201d as he likes to call it. These last few years have been really challenging from a mental health standpoint, and I really wanted to write about this part of my life which I think has affected me a lot. But because of my dad I really didn\u2019t have the ability to write in my essays about these struggles. Looking back now, I think another reason I didn\u2019t want to write too much about it is because I really did not want it to be how admission officers saw me. Maybe this is just internalized transphobia, but I wanted to be considered for just my achievements, not for being \u201cLGBT in Stem.\u201d (I\u2019m NOT trying to say that\u2019s a bad thing, it\u2019s just how I felt during this process).\n\nEven though I wasn\u2019t able to apply as transfem, the last (and definitely most important) reason I chose Berkeley was because of the LGBTQ+ resources the campus provides. I\u2019ll have my own insurance plan and bank account (with money I\u2019ve been saving for 4 years) separate from my parents, and there are even counselors that can help me track my progress with HRT and overall mental well being. I was even able to request LGBTQ affirming housing, so I can actually dress how I feel! It\u2019s honestly so amazing and Berkeley was one of the only schools that had these options, so I was thrilled to be accepted.\n\nFor anyone applying to college now that is also trans, some advice I want to give is to not try to hide it, unless it\u2019s **for your own safety**. Even though there was a part of me that didn\u2019t want to write about it because I felt like it would get in the way of the rest of my application, I honestly see that was a dumb way to think; it is a part of my life that I deserved to share with others as it helped define much of my high school career. Also, try to do as much research as possible into each of your colleges and find what resources they have that can help you for the future. My college list pretty much consisted of only schools that at least had some available resources or communities, and were in **states that do not have anti-trans laws**. Also be sure to check out the **college pride index** for overall reviews of LGBT resources at certain colleges. **Therapists, counselors, support groups, inclusive bathrooms and housing, even LGBTQ+ staff and professors** should be aspects that you consider before applying. Even if you decide not to represent yourself as trans or LGBT for safety reasons like me or other factors, these steps can still help immensely in applying to colleges that will actually help you as you become independent.\n\nWith that being said\u2026Gob Ears!!!"

Also my ACT score was low compared to the average of most of the schools I applied to but I didn't let that deter me because a test score is not reflective of a majority of the qualities I have. "

I really hope I can achieve my dream because not only will I be helping others, but I will also be the first person in my family to pursue a medical degree.\n\n**P.S I'm also the first person in my family to get a full ride to college which is crazy**"

I didn't really connect with him until the second semester of my 11th grade year, which is mostly my bad. We ballin tho; a few of the students in younger grades have told me that he speaks about me with high regard. The letter wasn't all too special though, but it definitely showcased my strengths.\n\nBusiness teacher: 8/10. Had a very good relationship with him, stated that I was one of the best students he has ever taught. His LOR was quite rushed because a teacher I had previously asked to write for me bailed on me last minute and stopped replying to my emails \ud83d\udc80 All good though because my business teacher pulled through even though his letter wasn't perfect.\n\nEnglish teacher: ??/10. Okay so essentially I didn't see her letter but she did identify me as a strong and creative writer with a sense of dry humor. My counsellor did say that she writes extremely positive rec letters for students so I trust him on that.\n\n**Essays**\n\n(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\nCommon App: Wrote about my love-hate relationship with pomegranates and how that inspired me to start studying the brain and how it works.\n\nSupplementals: They were honestly pretty generic imo. For both BU and WashU I just spoke about some of the unique aspects of the schools that I liked. I do think my NYU supp was the strongest though; I wrote about my experience taking care of my partially blind dog and how the values I gained would contribute to being a student on campus.\n\n**Decisions** (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\nAcceptances:\n\nNYU (RD): committed!!\n\nUofT (all 3 campuses)\n\nWestern (dk why I applied for business in hindsight.

I may have had an easier time getting in compared to other international applicants, although I'm not too sure if this assumption is accurate. What I will say though, is just go for it and apply! My ECs were frankly all over the place and I didn't really have solid AP courses either. I will say that I did not have a grade below 90 for the entire course of my 4 years, so maybe that compensated. God knows how I made it into NYU lol \ud83d\udc80\n\nHope everyone is happy with their results! Stay popping my girlies \ud83d\ude0d\n\n&#x200B;"

I know I applied to more schools than most people will, and as an international student I was already at a slight disadvantage from not being able to visit schools and not having a strong understanding of each school's \"culture\" but if you're in the US, please make sure you understand each school's vibe and if you find yourself straining to complete a why us essay, take that as a sign that you might not be a great fit.\n\nIn my case, I definitely shouldn't have applied to schools like Penn or BU and instead picked more LACs and replaced Penn with Columbia but being a prestige demon during applications completely clouded my judgment.\n\nI see many students on this sub and on a2c that have very structured plans for their career and education so if you're like these students, you don't need to apply to as many schools as I did. Find schools you like and that fit your career goals and that match your academic culture preferences and apply to those, even if they're less \"prestigious\".\n\nIn the end, I'm happy to go to UCLA. I think I'm a good fit for the school and the political science department seems great, plus saving \\~$100k compared to my other private options doesn't hurt. It also worked out that I think my background sets me up well for recruiting for UCLA's major finance clubs so I can pursue IB instead of needing to apply to law schools as a KJD.\n\nSee you all in Westwood <3"

Wrote about how although others defined my identity, the decisions that I choose to make define my identity and how I overcame it and was able to transition to regular classes in the 3rd grade.\n* Essay 3 - Wrote about an experience solving a math problem that I encountered when I was working in construction.

I did this for four years. I was an all-state trumpet player for junior and senior year. I was the head trumpet leader my senior year. I participated in several college honor bands. I won plenty of state wide awards from trumpet. I went a bit more in depth about this extracurricular for my common app essay. Band was a massive part of my life because it is what took me from a 3.0 weighted 2.6 unweighted student my freshman year to a 3.8uw 4.3w student my sophomore, junior, and senior year. \r  \n\r  \n\\#2 I was speaker of the house at my states Boy's State program.

I mostly worked fast food or paper routes. However, last year I stopped working fast food and started working that Museum job I mentioned earlier. \r  \n\r  \n\\#9 I read a lot of political theory.

It was a very baller letter of recommendation. For legal reasons, I did not see the letter of rec. ;)  8.5/10\n\nMy second letter of recommendation was from my AP world history and AP Human Geo teacher. I did not get to read this one, but me and this teacher got along very well. He seemed more than happy to write me a letter of recommendation, and one of my friends asked him for a letter of recommendation for a summer program and that letter of rec was beautiful. So I am assuming that the letter of rec was decent. 9.5/10 \n\nInterviews\r  \n\r  \nI did not do this.\r  \n\rEssays\r  \n\r  \nI spent about a week on my common app essay. I wrote about how I learned to become a leader from love and not a leader from wanting respect or power. I put it in the context of me getting head trumpet leader my senior year. My junior year, despite being the third best trumpet player in the band, I did not get trumpet leader. As a matter of fact, a sophomore and two seniors who were both worse players than me got leadership instead. I then dedicated my self to proving that my band directors made a mistake in not choosing me. However, over the course of my junior year I learned what it meant to be a leader because you love and care about something or someone rather than being a leader simply to prove you're the best. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rest of my essay's were garbage. I did them all the night before applications were due. I was very burnt out by the end of second term. \r  \n\r  \n\r\rDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\r  \n\r  \nAcceptances:\r  \n\r\rUniversity of Nebraska Lincoln (EA, this is my state school and it has automatic acceptance so it was my safety school. I also received the maximum amount of scholarship the college of Arts and sciences give out which is full tuition ) \n\nUniversity of Minnesota (Deferred EA--->A)\n\nUniversity of Connecticut (RD, $100,000 leadership scholarship)\n\nPurdue University (RD)\n\nHoward University (RD, 13,000$ scholarship and like 10,000 in grants too)\n\nFordham University (RD, like have tuition in scholarships and grants. so like around 40k I think)\n\nBates College (RD, 78,000$ per year in grants assuming fasfa stays the same.) ATTENDING!\n\n\r  \nWaitlists:\r  \n\r\r  \nBoston College (RD)\n\nBrandeis University (RD)\n\nOccidental College (RD)\n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (RD) \r\r  \n\r\r  \n\rRejections: \n\noh boy get ready\n\nBoston University (RD)\n\nBrown University (RD)\n\nCornell University ILR (RD)\n\nNew York University (RD)\n\nNorthwestern University (RD)\n\nOhio State university (RD) I do not even know what I did wrong here\n\nUniversity of Michigan (RD)\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame (RD)\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (RD)\r  \n\r\n\nUniversity of Rochester (RD)\n\nWashington University in St. Louis.

I was really happy with it though, and my mom liked it, so that was good enough.

I don't have the craziest resume, especially compared to the incredible people on this subreddit, so I never would have thought I would get into the school of my dreams.

Attended in 9th and 10th grade. 40 hrs / week for 5 weeks\n7. Track and field. Basically prepared for an annual 10k run in my city. 2-5 hrs / week during school months\n8. Yale Young African Scholar. Was pretty mid to be honest. Was probabily a few hours a day for a week or something\n\n\r**Awards/Honors**\r  \n\r\n\n1. Rise for the World Global Winner\n2. Atlas Fellow\n3. Recepient of one of two full scholarships at my current high school, after ranking 11th/300,000+ at a national end of middle school exam\n4. 2 others that can easily be traced back to me so I will not detail to avoid being doxxed\r  \n\r\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\r  \n\r\n\n* College Counselor: She was my counselor in 11th grade only. I was much closer to the previous counselor (who helped me get into all of the summer programs) but I think this one liked me too.\n* Theatre / Band / TOK / IB Coordinator: Probably knew me the deepest and for the longest. We did a bunch of cool stuff together outside of classes (theatre performances, musicals, band performances, etc.). She saw me grow, from a student who couldn't even speak English at first (my native language is French in a French-speaking country) to who I am now. She was also my advisor for EC#1 and helped us tremendously to get to the place we are right now. I think she is the most likely to have had an outstanding recommendation for me.\n* Physics teacher: He probably knew me the most academically, although he only taught me for 2 years, in 10th and 11th grades. He was chill and liked nerdy stuff like me so I liked him a lot! He wrote me the rec for SSP and I got in to that one, so I assume this rec was good as well.\n\n\r\r**Interviews**\n\n* \rGot an interview from MIT. Went pretty well and the interviewer told me that I did very well at the end.\n* No interview from Stanford and VT though.\n\n\r\r**Essays**\r  \n\r\n\n* Grinded the Common App essay for months. I am still proud of it right now! Gave a pretty cohesive story of myself, from my background to what inspires me to do what I do, to my hopes for the future. I think this essay was very solid.\n* Stanford Supplementals: Also grinded those. I added a few jokes here and there which I thought were risky at the time, but looking back were not that bad. I tried to be as original as possible with each prompt so as to give a different view of my personality with each one. \n* MIT Essays: Rushed in the very last minutes before the application was due. Probably not my best writing, but I think they were decent.\n\n\r\n\n**Additional Information section:**\n\nI added that I was doing my IB Extended Essay in math, and explained the topic a bit. Talked also about a failed startup I worked on with some friends, which I had put a lot of time and effort in.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\r  \n\r  \nAcceptances:\n\n* >!\rREA: Stanford University! I have the biggest crush on this school lol. Became my #1 school at the end of 11th grade, although I was an MIT guy since 9th grade. After being accepted, I didn't want to apply to other schools, but did do MIT on a whim before the deadline :)!<\n* >!EA: Virginia Tech. Was my early safety (would have applied to more if I didn't get into Stanford though). Was allowed to apply despite Stanford REA because this is a public school.!<\n\n\r\r\rWaitlists:\r\n\n* >!None!<\r\n\nRejections:\r\n\n* >!RD: MIT. Hurt a lot ngl. It was literally the only school that could make me think twice about going to Stanford, hence why I only applied to it despite pressures from friends / family to apply to Harvard and the likes, which I did not like as much. But I got over it lol. I think I would have had a better shot had I worked more on my essays.!<\r\n\n**My advice:**\n\nFrom my experience above, I think the main takeaway is that starting early is key! Whether it's about applying to cool summer programs in 9th grade, or working on your essays early, or maintaining a good GPA standing from the beginning. Also, being proactive is a good attitude to have. Talking to teachers, applying to things even when you don't think you'll get in, etc. Things will be alright! Trust the process, but don't forget that you will have to put a lot of effort in as well."

This was fairly ordinary, but went into great detail about Princeton and I had a nice chat. \n- Harvard: (10/10) was told I should have no problem getting into any school, and he would be shocked if I did not get in, huge confidence booster. \n- Duke: (10/10) was quite surprised when told I had the best extracurriculars she had ever seen. Went into great detail about beyond what I had in my application. \n- Northwestern: (8/10) honestly went solid, but nothing special. \n- other interviews: (10/10) consistently went super well. \n\n\n# Essays: \n\nCommon App: (5/10) I loved it when I submitted in, but in hindsight I think I could of done better. I talked about a wrongdoing that has happened in my life, and why I now hope to be an equity attorney. \n\nSupplements: (8/10) these varied quite a bit. Some were 1000/10 such as Yale, but I quite literally had 2 typos in my Northwestern application, and another in Duke. \n\n# Decisions: \n\n- Princeton: wl\n- Harvard: A\n- Yale: A \n- Columbia: A\n- Brown: A\n- Penn: A\n- Dartmouth: A \n- Cornell: wl -> A\n- Duke: wl\n- Northwestern: wl\n- Vanderbilt: A\n- JHU: A \n- UVA: A (full ride) (Committed!!!)\n- UNC: A (full ride) \n- CMU: A\n\n\n# Additional comments: \n\nAfter applying to Yale REA, I received a likely letter and decided to apply to reach schools alone. I think I received a mass amount of waitlists because of being test optional and I hope that this post can shed some light on what a test optional applicant with good stats otherwise can potentially expect. I honestly don\u2019t think my application was that special, but in the end I never did anything for a college and I am happy for it. I will be attending UVA and graduating early at that.\n\nWahoowa!!"

She also grew up on a farm so we related to each other a lot and I'm sure she had great things to say.\n* Guidance Counselor (6/10): I never talked to her and she's the only counselor in our school \ud83d\udc80 (so she has to deal with like 200 kids). She was really nice when I did meet her though.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* Stanford (10/10): It was virtual, but went really well. She asked a number of atypical questions (like which historical figure I would choose to eat dinner with) but she enjoyed my responses. I also spent like 20 minutes just talking about the anime club and she was laughing the entire time, so I guess that was a good sign.\n* MIT (8/10): This also went really well, but didn't feel as \"friendly\" as the Stanford one if that makes sense. Most questions centered on why I wanted to go to MIT and my STEM-focused ECs.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App (9/10): I talked about living with a single dad on the farm, specifically about how I developed a really close relationship with this one cow (which I named Daisy) when I was like 8. Everyone I showed it to seemed to enjoy it and it kind of tied into my entire narrative of a small town gal\n\nSupplementals (9/10): I poured my heart out into the Stanford ones and spent like 2 months on them. They mostly centered around my life living in the middle of buttfuck, Iowa (although a few were on my CS ECs) and my English teacher physically laughed when she read a couple. I spent like 3 days on the MIT ones (which wasn't too hard as I recycled a lot of the Stanford essays), but in hindsight I think the lack of time made them less polished.\n\n**Decisions**\n\nEA\n\n* University of Iowa (this is where I was 90% sure I was going to go anyway): >!Accepted + Scholarship!<\n* Stanford: >!Accepted (WHAT THE FUCK.

Given that I wasn't even USACO plat I thought I had no chance, but I guess my essays carried. Their aid rivaled my state school as well which was nice. I was worried that I hadn't focused on Computer Science enough within my essays, but in hindsight I think that developing a narrative about me being a rural dairy farmer interested in tech caught the heart of the admissions committee."

I thought I didn't have a chance at any t10s because all my ECs were at the school or local level. Before the waitlists, for the longest time, I was stuck between Northwestern and USC and even ended up committing to USC. Compared to the other schools, Princeton and Harvard's financial aid was honestly insane. After getting waitlisted I wrote a letter of continued interest for Harvard, but not for Princeton. However, I think what got me into both was winning Presidential Scholar. Let me know if you guys have any questions! Good luck to all future college applicants!"

Featured on news twice (10, 11, 12).\n4. Local Leftist Teens (Not Actual Name) Founder. Group for local high school activists/passionate leftists to come together and discuss how we can promote leftist ideas to the general public/get real issues real attention.

Said I was his best student both years I took him. Don't know much else. We were really close; he was also the teacher sponsor for real debate and the more informal debate club I founded, so he saw me compete lots and saw my debate skills/political knowledge. 9.5/10.\n\nLOR 2: From AP calc/calc 3 teacher. Said I had very unusual math strength, especially for someone who isn't going into math. Was surprised when I told him I wanted to study PoliSci instead of something STEM. We were very close tho. Probably 8/10.\n\nDidn't get one from my research mentor.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nStanford: 5/10. Online. Idk the guy seemed to not really care that much/wasn't too attentive, but this might've just been bc it was online. Conversation only lasted like 25 minutes max. I rlly don't think the guy would've had that much at all to say/tell the admissions committee about me but yeah.\n\nUPenn: 9/10. Talked about capitalism. Guy was from Wharton, so yeah, different paths for sure but he seemed to really be interested in what I was talking about. He thought I was smart and said my resume was incredible/very professional.\n\nHarvard: 10/10. Interviewer seemed to really enjoy our conversation. Lasted about 2 hours; we talked about philosophy lots. Interviewer said I was the most impressive interviewee she'd ever seen.\n\nYale: 6/10. Talked about politics (don't) and my interviewer clearly didn't agree with me. Might be exaggerating how bad this was but idrk. Guy was chill tho. Realistically, it was prolly better than I thought and I doubt the guy would write bad stuff for us disagreeing. We actually had some pretty good conversation. Idk.\n\nVandy: 8/10. Talked about southern environment of Vandy; that's what I wanted to know abt the school (that environment's implications on the school's culture) so I just asked. Good conversation and definitely made me like the school a lot more. Much more focused on the school as opposed to me and my interests than all my other interviews.\n\n**Essays**\n\nHonestly, I spent summer/well into the school year on my PS, but my supps were all done pretty quickly. I made sure they were good, but I didn't have a private counselor or anything like that, so it was pretty much just my own judgement. My PS was about activism/how I got into politics, and ik I'm biased and everything, but I really do think it was an incredibly strong essay. The only person who read it was my AP lit teacher, and she said it was easily the best PS she'd ever seen and said it was \"beautifully written.\" I consider myself a strong writer (lots of experience/I read lots), so I think my essays were all well written; some of the supps could've had better content, tho. I was also making some jokes in my essays, so they were kinda funny at times, so yk take that how you will. I only made jokes when they came naturally; nothing was contrived/fake or anything. I'd rate my PS a 9.5/10 and my supps an average of a 7.5/10.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* >!Harvard (RD)!<\n* >!Stanford (RD)!<\n* >!Princeton (RD)!<\n* >!Duke (RD) -> committed!!!!!!!!!!!<\n* >!Columbia (RD+likely letter)!<\n* >!UChicago (EA)!<\n* >!UPenn (RD)!<\n* >!Brown (RD)!<\n* >!Northwestern (RD)!<\n* >!Vandy (RD+full tuition scholarship)!<\n* >!Georgetown (EA)!<\n* >!UNC (EA+full ride)!<\n* >!My state school (EA)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* >!MIT (deferred EA, rejected RD)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* >!Yale (RD)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nAfter UChicago EA came out, I decided to only apply to schools RD that I thought I might take over UChicago, so I scratched all my targets that I'd started writing for (UChicago's FA was good). I got very good FA offers from multiple schools, which is why I didn't take the UNC full ride or Vandy full tuition scholarship (I probably would have otherwise). HSP offers were a tad (and I really mean a tad) cheaper than Duke's\u2014but I alr liked Duke so much and fell in love with it when I visited campus. Duke felt like a perfect fit. If y'all were wondering, I didn't take the WL spot at Yale, and I wouldn't have gone to MIT, so yeah\u2014go Blue Devils!!!!!!!!!!!"

Programming/game design \u2013 I simply enjoy programming in many languages and designing basic video games using C# in Unity\n3. Violin \u2013 tbh I have no clue why I put this, I began learning at the end of my junior year as a hobby because I liked orchestral music\n4. Service hours \u2013 I\u2019ve completed over 130 service hours throughout my time in high school, including religious service, service to the poor, and service to the community\n5. School house leader \u2013 attended a school leadership camp in the summer of 2021 (going into my junior year) and then served as a leader and the communications coordinator for my house during my junior year (for houses, think Harry Potter but there\u2019s 10 of them)\n6. National Math Honor Society/Mu Alpha Theta \u2013 participated in Catholic Math League and AMC math test competitions, but nothing serious (we just kinda did no practice and took the tests when the days came lol)\n7. Danger of A.I. research paper \u2013 wrote a 37-page research paper discussing A.I. and its potential and interviewed a tech professional for my Honors Focus Research course\n8. National Honor Society \u2013 pretty self-explanatory (only allowed to join junior or senior year, so I did this for two years); requires 5 tutoring hours each semester\n9. Tutoring \u2013 basically tutored kids in math and computer science a lot, especially this one kid in cs basically every week during my junior year\n10. Senior GOYA (Greek Orthodox Youth of America) community member \u2013 basically a member of my Greek Orthodox Church\u2019s youth group and met for activities (liturgical/worship services and discussions/fun activities) a few times each month\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. Mathematics department award (sophomore year) \u2013 given to one student per grade\n2. Principal\u2019s list every semester (4.0 weighed or above) \u2013 a quarter of my grade was on this last year so doesn\u2019t mean much imo lol\n3. School scholars program \u2013 about 10% of my grade is in this, requires certain courses to be taken and a certain GPA to be maintained for a scholarship\n4. Graduated summa cum laude \u2013 obtained by maintaining a 4.0 weighted and taking extra courses (such as Honors Focus Research)\n5. National STEM Honor Society \u2013 member since sophomore year and also school president\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCounselor letter (8/10) \u2013 I don\u2019t know much of about the letter to be honest, especially since my counselor and I didn\u2019t really meet much, but I do know she liked me and thought of me as a very bright student, so imma guess above average\n\nAP Lang teacher (9/10 or 10/10) \u2013 I first had her for Honors Argumentation & Rhetoric sophomore year; she and I clicked well and I did very well in her AP class junior year, despite only getting a 3 on the exam (not my greatest exam day, and I also rushed a lot on the final essay); she used my essay as a sample across all her AP classes once and called me one of the best writers she has ever taught, along with recommending several students from her 22-23 classes to me for writing help\n\nAP Calc teacher (7/10) \u2013 calc was hands down my best subject, and I\u2019ve had this teacher for AB junior year and for BC senior year; in BC, I got the highest score on her midterm (I\u2019m pretty sure) and definitely on her final exam in the history of her teaching (which has been going on for about 10 years); I\u2019ve heard though that this teacher typically writes similar letters for good students with just some extra info that pertains to each student specifically, so it might not have stood out compared to the letters written by her for other students\n\nAP CSA teacher (7/10) \u2013 similar story to the calc letter; I did really well in the class as the only sophomore, and my teacher has been my robotics coach for all four years of high school, but I know he does a similar thing to calc, where he writes similar letters for each good student but some extra specific information to the student; this might\u2019ve blended in with my friend\u2019s letter, as he applied to similar schools and also requested a letter from this teacher\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* All of these interviews were done through Zoom\n* Princeton (8/10) \u2013 my first interview, and probably also my best; he was an older alumni who majored in history I believe, but he had an interest in A.I. and programming like I did; we clicked and I told him a lot about my robotics team and my coding projects; additionally, he loved Greece, and since I was Greek, we had that connection too; he also said he hadn\u2019t seen a whole lot of programmers in interviews recently, and he seemed to be pleasantly surprised\n* Stanford (6/10) \u2013 second interview; the dude was very nice but it kinda seemed like a \u201cquestion-and-answer\u201d interview; he seemed pretty interested in what I had to say and asked me a lot about robotics as well, but certainly wasn\u2019t enthralled with anything\n* MIT (4/10) \u2013 last interview, and not very great at that; this interview was very \u201cquestion-and-answer\u201d and she just kept asking me basic questions; she gave me the bruh face throughout and it was kinda uncomfortable, although she was very nice; to make matters worse, I replied to the email to schedule the interview like three days after I got the initial interview email, because I was on a school retreat without phones\n\n**Essays**\n\nOverall, I think my essays were pretty strong, and I think my Common App essay in particular must\u2019ve been strong. It was a graded assignment for my AP Lit class, and I got an A on it after months of working on it (my AP Lit teacher was a strict grader). I wrote a story about a student I tutored in cs a lot and sprinkled coding metaphors throughout. As for supplementals, some of them I spent some more time on (a few weeks or even months), some of them I spent a few days on, and for like a few of them I wrote the day before they were due, but I don\u2019t think they were that bad; I really tried to make them specific to me and engaging, although none of my supplements were reviewed by a teacher or advisor.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* ASU Barrett (EA)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Georgia Tech (RD) -> rejected\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* MIT (RD)\n* Stanford (RD)\n* Harvard (RD)\n* Princeton (RD)\n* Caltech (RD)\n* UC Berkeley (RD)\n* Carnegie Mellon (RD)\n\n**Additional Information (my thoughts and insights):**\n\nI\u2019ll share some of my insights really quick. I definitely believe my test scores were a problem, along with my ECs: I didn\u2019t do any summer programs, publish any papers, participate in any real competitions, etc. As for the test scores, I took the ACT three times and the second time was my best; in middle school, I developed a bad habit of spending hours on tests (a strange perfectionistic, double checking tendency) and although it thankfully mostly went away in high school (I do every school test now with no extra time), I still struggle not to get anxious during the ACT and SAT and seem to never finish on time for the reading comprehension portions. After my ACT tries, I had the chance to take the SAT once, which I did, and due to its more lenient timing, I did better than any ACT attempt, but worse on the math. Ultimately, I didn't do early action for any school except for my safety school's honors college (which is test blind) in the hopes of significantly raising my test score before regular decision, which didn't really happen.\n\nAnother issue was that my school doesn\u2019t publish rank, so I couldn\u2019t say where I was ranked in my application; additionally, it wasn\u2019t until after applications were sent that I was confirmed to be ranked 1st/valedictorian.\n\nOverall, life hasn\u2019t been a breeze since covid hit in freshman year. I\u2019ve went through much overthinking, a lack of motivation, and even major surgery last summer; in the end, however, I am not as distraught as you may think. I am actually quite happy to go to my state school\u2019s honors college, especially since a lot of my friends are going to the same college. I mentally prepared myself to receive all rejections, so I wasn\u2019t very demotivated upon getting the results, especially because I knew what a lottery these admissions could be.\n\nAnyway, thanks to all of those who took the time to read this, and I hope y\u2019all continue to share your insights and advice with others."

My interviewer actually went to my school, so we also talked about that too. She didn't ask me too many questions, just the basics, and I was basically done answering questions in like 20 minutes.\n* Stanford: Also went pretty well, interviewer was nice and chill, we talked for a good bit, maybe like 40 minutes?\n* Princeton: A really weird interview; my interviewer asked me like 1 question and then said \"this is useless for your apps\" and then made me ask questions, so it was over in like 15 minutes.\n* Cornell: It was a pretty stock-standard interview, the usual barrage of questions from a middle-aged guy. Like, 40 minutes.\n* Yale: Another weird interview, but in a good way; my interviewer just started talking about random stuff and asked me about crypto and the stock market and politics. Idk what's up with Yale, they just admit the weirdest interviewers or whatever.\n* Brown: I recorded my video the day before because I forgor it existed. It was just me talking to my 144p MacBook camera about the game I made.\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Personal statement: I had a hard time coming up with a topic, but eventually settled on an animated show I watched and how it inspired me to be more artistic, even though a lot of my interested are math and STEM-related, just to show a different side of me.\n* Essays: I think most of my essays are quite okay; I don't recall any standouts, except for my Why Us essays, those were kinda bangers.\n\n***Decisions***\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n* UC Irvine RD\n* Columbia RD\n* Caltech RD\n* USC RD\n\n**Waitlists (that all ended up being rejections):**\n\n* Harvard RD\n* Yale RD\n* Cornell RD\n* UPenn RD\n* Princeton RD\n* CMU RD\n* UChicago EA\n* UC San Diego RD\n* UCLA RD\n* WashU RD\n* Rice RD\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* MIT EA (deferred -> waitlisted -> accepted -> committed!, a really wild ride with this one :P)\n* Stanford RD\n* Brown RD\n* UC Berkeley RD (EECS)\n* UIUC EA (CS)\n* Purdue RD (CS)\n* Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology RD"

I read this, and it was beautiful. 10/10. My counselor from my senior year kind of hated me cause I wanted to go to 'fancy' schools instead of the school most kids there wanted to go.

I tried to draw some crazy metaphor between running and math. Who knows what I was on about. My supplementals were probably a bit better, but I shouldn't have mentioned wanting to double major at schools who really don't want you to double major. I wrote about unique experiences like growing up around the world but I think all my essays were a bit cliche and forgettable.\n\nI tried to write an extra essay about how moving high schools had affected my rankings and made me look like I hadn't taken advantage of opportunities, but I am not sure it was well written or well received.\r  \n\r  \n**Decisions**\r  \n\r  \nAcceptances:\r  \n\r  \nColorado School of Mines (they don't even have a BME program, just applied here cause my mom wanted me to, got in on rolling decisions with a $14k/year scholarship)\r  \n\r  \nGeorgia Tech (attending!

I thought that top 1% in standardized tests = top 1% of college admissions. No one in my family had ever applied to the really prestigious colleges, and everyone had always went where they wanted to, and I was told I would too. In hindsight, my application was pretty forgettable beyond my test scores. Georgia Tech was my safety school lol. It turned out okay though, I love it here. Also, it's been awhile since I applied haha, so I think I am forgetting stuff, but these are the major details."

One person per year group gets it but for that year, I had the most amongst the school. (Year 10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCounselor: Our head of education. I don't really have a lot of personal connections with her but I think she should have wrote it nicely and well. (7-8/10).\n\nBut for my mid-year report, I think it was quite messed up due to hard exams + high in-school grade boundaries. She also converted A-level grades to GPA, which I don't even know how she did it and why she did it. Hence I think the GPA must have been lower than what I should be getting if they were put as A-level grades. I am assuming this and the mid-year report might have done something like acceptance -> waitlist or waitlist -> rejection. This happened to someone in our school.\n\nTeacher 1: My maths teacher. He is a very professional, friendly, nice and just a fantastic teacher. One of the best teachers I've ever seen. I do well in his class and I had some sessions with him for my UK application before I started my maths lessons, so I assume I am pretty close to him and he is really nice to me as well. (10/10)\n\nTeacher 2: My English teacher for my GCSE year and my EPQ teacher. She is a lovely person in general. I wouldn't say I am particularly close to her but she is really kind and she was happy to write a recommendation when I asked her. (8-9/10)\n\nOther: CS professor back in my home country. I had personal sessions with him to get introduced to projects that are done in his university (and led by him), had a chance to evaluate these and wrote my own code based on this. He knows me quite well and he is a very nice person as well, and also very professional. (9-10/10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interviews**\n\nUPenn - alumni interview. It was more of a session to learn more about UPenn and the interviewer to learn more about me. The interviewer was really really nice and chill too. I just enjoyed the time speaking to him, he was just amazing.\n\nCornell - alumni. This is just to ask questions about Cornell. More of a Q&A than the UPenn one. Again, the interviewer was so nice and lovely, and she was just amazing. Both of my interviews had really good interviewers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essays**\n\nThe quality of the words or fluency was good in my opinion, but thinking back I think some essays that I wrote might have been too general. I literally didn't know how to write them properly, and I didn't have a lot of feedback until mid-December. So my U Washington Seattle essay was actually so bad (idek why I submitted it), and my UC essay was worse than my Common App essays in general.\n\nFor the personal statement essay, I wrote about my challenges and how I overcame them. I think this was a good essay in my opinion. Compared to my other essays, I think was not generic at all.\n\nHonestly, I don't really know how to comment about essays since we do it in a different way in the UK and their writing styles are completely different. Hence I cannot comment too much about if this is a good essay or a bad essay, but overall I think some might have been too generic.\n\nI tried to look into every aspect of their college websites and write stuff, but I don't know how many students do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nI will separate these into US and non-US, as my 1st choice is not a US university.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***US***\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nUC San Diego (RA) - Math + CS (second choice major) -> committed but second choice; see below\n\n\\------ below this I applied because I was getting rejected from a lot of universities so I applied to those around like March because my parents were worried about me not getting into any uni ---------\n\nArizona State University (RA) - CS + $14,500 per term scholarship\n\nUniversity of Arizona (RA) - CS + $22,000 per year scholarship\n\nUniversity of Texas Dallas (RA) - CS\n\nUniversity of Utah (RA) - CS\n\nIowa State University (RA) - CS + $12,000 per year Presidential Scholarship + $2,000 per year LAS Excellence Scholarship\n\nOregon State University (RA) - CS + $12,000 per year Europe and Central Asia Award Scholarship, Offered Honors College (if admitted free, which is $1,500 per year)\n\nUniversity of Washington - Bothell (RA) - CS\n\nUniversity of Michigan - Flint (RA) - CS + $14,000 per year True Blue Scholarship (First-year Merit Scholarship)\n\nUniversity of Michigan - Dearborn (RA) - CS + $12,500 per year scholarship\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\nGeorgia Tech (RA) - CS -> Rejected\n\nNYU (RA) - Tandon CS -> Rejected (they are saying their process is not over yet, but their incoming first-year class is full and it is unlikely to change)\n\nU Michigan - Ann Arbor (RA) - CS -> Waiting (but at this point, I think I'm rejected)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nCarnegie Mellon University (RA) - CS\n\nUC Berkeley (RA) - CS\n\nCornell University (RA) - CS\n\nUniversity of Washington - Seattle (RA) - CS\n\nUCLA (RA) - CS\n\nUIUC (RA) - CS\n\nUPenn (RA) - CS\n\nUSC (RA) - CS\n\nUC Irvine (RA) - CS\n\nUniversity of Washington - Tacoma (RA) - CS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Non-US***\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nUniversity College London, United Kingdom - CS(G400) -> firm choice and 1st choice (conditional offer A\\* A\\* A, A\\* required in maths)\n\nThe University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom - CS(G401) -> declined (conditional offer 3A\\*)\n\nThe University of Waterloo, Canada - Math Co-op\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nKorean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea- CS\n\nKing's College London, United Kingdom - CS\n\nUniversity of Warwick, United Kingdom - CS\n\nUniversity of St Andrews, United Kingdom - CS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsidering I didn't know too much about how to write a good essay + our school didn't even give that much support for US applications + I didn't do a lot of stuff for ECs because I didn't know I would apply to the US, maybe it is not a bad outcome and expected outcome anyway.\n\nBut yeah, depending on whether I meet my conditions for UCL, I would end up either in London or San Diego.\n\nWhat I learnt: well, CS is really tough, especially in the US, and especially as an international.\n\nHope everything goes well for everyone who reads this, and fingers crossed & good luck to those who have A-level exams remaining just like me :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am reconsidering my university choices now after reading comments & speaking to a few people. Thank you to everyone who provided information :)"

She was also really interested in farming and how it works, which I was more than happy to wax lyrical about. It gave me a really good impression of UPenn. \n\nColumbia - Not bad, interviewer kept on asking if I thought that Columbia was the best school I applied to, which I found a little odd, but eventually we ended up talking about some economic history, as it is an area which we were both interested in. \n\nCambridge - 1/2 good 1/2 bad. For Cambridge history there was a general interview and a source interview (basically a test), I thought I did really well on the general and terribly on the source, but in the rejection feedback, it turned out it was actually the other way round.   \n\nEssays  \nMy UChicago essay was something I seriously enjoyed, and actually one of the reasons I ended up choosing it over UPenn. The why Chicago one was good, but it was the wierd one I loved. It was about cheating on an economics exam and how someone got caught giving a friend the answers becase they got Smith and Keynes mixed up, predicated on the palendrome of \"borrow or rob\". It was much better than the other essays for my US appliactions, which in retrospect all lacked a little bit of pizazz. My CommonApp esssay was good, but not outstanding, it was a nice rendition of what it has been to grow up in a brilliant but EXTREMELY disfunctional family. \n\nHonestly, if I were to reapply I would pay more attention to the essay prompts and let them guide me on where to apply, for example I did not have enough time to apply for Stanford but I should have becuase I was genuinely interested in thier prompts, and wish that I did not apply to Columbia as I found thier essays tedious and boring.   \n\n\nAcceptances:  \nUniveristy of Chicago - RD (Committed)\n\nUPENN - RD \n\nLSE (UK)\n\nUCL (UK)   \n\n\nRejections:  \nColumbia   \nCambridge (very sad)   \nSt Andrews \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional Information \n\nLooking back I am really pleased, and surprised with how I have done, especially considering some of the crazy ECs that a lot of the American kids have which I am severely lacking.

I never read any of them so I\u2019m unsure how I\u2019d rate them, but I\u2019d say they were pretty decent since I was a fairly involved student.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nYale (0/10): Got into an argument about politics and young people being involved in advocacy :((\n\nPrinceton (10/10): Coming off of my Yale interview I was super nervous for this one, but it actually went really well! He had a couple of out-of-the-box questions but based on his responses to my answers I think I was able to handle them well. We exchanged a couple of emails after the interview and he wished me luck!\n\nMIT (10000000000/10): I loved this interview so much! We had so many common interests and our interview lasted for over an hour. As someone who wasn\u2019t the biggest MIT fan before, this interview made me want to attend so bad.\n\nCornell (7/10): Not sure if this counts since Cornell\u2019s interviews aren't evaluative - but this was a pretty basic interview! Nothing too special, but nothing went wrong either.\n\nDuke (6/10): My interviewer seemed very busy and was lowkey preoccupied with work. He was super sweet, but I wasn\u2019t really able to develop a strong connection with him.\n\nHarvard (8/10): We met in person so I was slightly nervous, but we had common interests and I thought that the conversation we had was pretty good!\n\n**Essays**\n\nLooking back, my common app essay was super basic \u2013 and it\u2019s a major part of my application that I wish I could change. I\u2019d say my supplementals were much better in quality.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n* State school #1: Accepted, honors college\n* State school #2: Accepted, honors college -> Attending\n* Yale (SCEA): Rejected! (this hurt so bad)\n* UW Seattle: Accepted\n* UC Davis: Accepted\n* UC San Diego: Accepted\n* Northeastern: Waitlisted\n* MIT: Rejected </3\n* UC Berkeley: Rejected\n* Harvard: Rejected\n* Cornell: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n* Columbia: Rejected\n* Princeton: Rejected\n* Duke: Rejected\n* Stanford: Rejected\n\n**Reflection/Additional thoughts:**\n\nThere is honestly so much I wish I could change about my application cycle. Although I did have the few oos acceptances that I would\u2019ve loved to attend - my family did not feel that it was financially worth it to go to any of them (even though they had originally encouraged me to apply to some of these schools!). Everyone says that it's important to find targets/safeties that you'd be happy at - but please make sure that your family is absolutely on board with these schools as well. Ultimately, I wish I had been more clear with my parents about the finances that came with each school on my college list, and crafted my college list to reflect schools that they would be willing to financially support me for. I also don\u2019t really have a clear spike in my activities, and while I don\u2019t regret any of what I did throughout high school, I can see how my application lacked a compelling storyline. Additionally, I really wish I had worked to develop my common app essay more. Getting rejected from Yale in the early round should have clued me in, but I ultimately decided to stick with my essay - and it's something I really regret.\n\nWhile I'm not exactly going to college where I had hoped, I'm extremely grateful that my state school is offering me a full ride. Although this process didn't turn out the way I had wanted, I'm honestly just excited that it's over!"

That said, the rejections from Stanford, MIT & Princeton hurt.

I couldn't find what awards I won in Science Olympiad and otherwise did not compete\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**(\n\nBriefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)\n\nPhysics and Biotechnology teacher (yes, you heard right, I submitted two STEM teachers while applying for a humanities major):\n\nngl these were probably both pretty average. I struggled with pretty bad anxiety (which I talk about more in the additional information section), so talking to teachers was extremely scary to me. I did good in both their classes and was a good group leader, but I didn't do anything outstanding (6/10)\n\nAdditional Recommendor-Piano Teacher: I read this and it was short but sweet (9/10)\n\n**Interviews**(Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)\n\nStanford (6/10): This was my first interview and therefore, it was pretty mid. I was super nervous and I think that was very clear when I anwsered the question. But the interviewer was very nice and I think she genuinaly liked the questions I asked.\n\nDuke (9/10): This went much better. She clearly liked my anwsers and gave me frequent compliments. We talked a lot more about personal stories.\n\nCornell (1000/10): The interviewer was a ball of sunshine. She was so vibrant and really seemed to like me. I could definetely feel that the interview was non-evaluative because she was clearly trying to persuade me to go to Cornell (and it def worked). She wanted me to email her if I got accepted and she would invite me to Cornell alumni parties and things.\n\n**Essays**(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)\n\nPersonal essay -- Talked about learning ASL and the Deaf meetups. Discussed how it helped me come out of my shell and realize that fear is not something to fight; rather, it is better to acknowledge it and continue despite it. Writing my personal statement was the hardest essay I had to write and it casued me a lot of stress and anxiety, so I didn't think it was that good. But everyone else that read it loved it so idk. (8/10)\n\n**\\*\\*Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\\*\\*Acceptances**:\n\nEA:\n\nUniversity of Maryland w/ CIVIC Program (I was disappoined I didn't get into the honors program, but got into a community service based community) (4.5k/year)\n\nRD:\n\nASU w/ honors (8k/year)\n\nU of A (didn't apply to honors) (also got highest merit based scholarship, but I don't remember how much)NAU (didn't apply to honors) (got higest merit-based scholarship, but I don't remember how much)\n\nUniversity of California Riverside w/ honors (13.5k/year)\n\nUniversity of California San Diego\n\n**University of Washington w/ Honors (7.2k/year) - ATTENDING!!!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWaitlists:\n\nNone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRejections:\n\nREA:\n\nStanford\n\nRD:\n\nDuke\n\nBrown\n\nCornell\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley\n\n**Additional Information**:None of my middle school friends went to the high school that I did, and I started experiencing extreme anxiety about making friends. I had already previously dealt with depression, and with the added stress I experienced frequent panic attacks. It got so bad that I wasn't able to leave my house without having an anxiety attack and I accrued many absences in freshman year. COVID and online school honestly saved me (who knew taking a person afraid of people away from the people would ease their anxiety lol). I was diagnosed with a Social Anxiety Disorder and was privledged enough to get therapy and medication during sophmore year, I started making friends in junior year, and by senior year I was functioning as a relatively normal human being.\n\nHowever, due to my mental health issues, my extra curriculars and letters of recommendations definitely lacked. I didn't talk about what I went through in my application because, one, I was worried about bias and, two, it's none of their business. Due to my disorder, rejections already cause a lot of anxiety (because I worry that other people don't like me like the admission officers) and I knew that if I put something that personal in my application and then got rejected (which was likely because I was applying to highly rejective schools), I would likely freak out. I was originally disappointed with my results (although they were expected), however no tears were shed. After visiting, UCSD and University of Washington (I had already visited the other schools), the choice was obvious to me. The University of Washington felt so right to me and I'm so excited to attend there in the fall. I also have won two scholarships (one national and one local) since my decision, and gotten a high paying summer internship that I'm really excited about! Go huskies!"

State Science Olympiad Competition (1st - Ornithology, 8th - Environmental Chemistry) - 11th grade\n2. Regional Science Olympiad Competition (2nd: Chemistry Lab, 2nd: Ornithology, 3rd: Environmental Chemistry) - 11th grade\n3. County STEM Award - 11th grade (idrk how significant this was tbh it seemed like a throwaway kinda thing; it was for my performance in Science Olympiad but they got the competition name wrong on my certificate T\\_T)\n4. Governor's Volunteer Service Award - 10th grade\n5. State Seal of Biliteracy Recipient in English and Chinese - 11th grade\n\n**Essays**\n\n1. Common App essay - had 2 versions, one for EA and another for RD. I would rate my first version (basically I compared my identity to a sandwich and made it a love story it was kinda weird T\\_T) like a 7/10 if I'm being generous and a solid 9/10 for my second version (I talked about how my being officer of Science Olympiad challenged me and made me grow as a person; it sounds cliche but I used a unique format that I'm pretty proud of)\n2. Supplemental essays - my EA supps were probably on average like a 6 or 7 out of 10, and my RD supps were an 8 to a 9. I tried to make them more creative/unique since I knew my ECs were on the weaker side when it came to the higher ranked schools and I knew that I was going to get in, my essays would play a major role in my acceptance. I spent so much time and so many rounds of editing with my dad asdfkljasd;lfkj\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n1. AP Chem teacher/Science Olympiad coach (11/10) - She really liked me and she's honestly my mom atp... I'm also an aide for her this year so I help set up labs for her and the entire science dept. She also assigns me other labs to prepare just for funsies and bc she trusts me apparently ???? Hopefully she can speak to the diligence and time I put in as a Scioly officer and my performance in the AP Chem class. Might also be worth mentioning that I tutored one of her current AP Chem kids?\n2. Wind Ensemble/Marching Band director (7.5/10) - I didn't have other STEM teachers as strong as my AP Chem teacher but my logic was that I would ask teachers who knew what I was like outside of school past the academic/stats/grades kind of thing; hopefully they could give some insight into my personality (ig that logic worked? idk) Since I was a section leader in marching band for 2 years I had some leadership in terms of that but I would often come in a couple minutes late to class tired asf cause we had band first period... Overall I still think he has a decent impression of me\n3. Internship advisor/prof (9/10) - He is a family friend of my parents and that's honestly how I got the internship T\\_T But he has a pretty good impression of me during the time I was there; I picked up things pretty quickly so I think that helped. Only submitted this to some schools I was applying to RD and some schools late in the EA cycle\n4. (only submitted after waitlist) Science Lab Assistant Manager (8.5/10) - Set up labs for the science department, had an overall good impression of me since I volunteered to complete other tasks and extra things outside of the labs I had to set up\n5. (only submitted after waitlist) School Principal (6.5/10) - Our class is \\~650 people and he only became the principal my sophomore year so I doubt he knew me that well; I sent my resume to him so hopefully he did something with that T\\_T\n\n**Results (woohooo!!)**\n\nEA Catholic University of America (accepted)\n\nRD CMU (accepted!!!)\n\nRD Cornell (waitlisted -> accepted -> committed!!!!)\n\nEA CWRU (waitlisted)\n\nRD Duke (rejected rip)\n\nRD Duke Kunshan (accepted somehow???)\n\nRD Northwestern (rejected, lol this one kinda made me a bit sad)\n\nRD Rice (waitlisted)\n\nEA UD (accepted)\n\nRD UIUC (accepted)\n\nEA UMBC (accepted)\n\nEA UMD (accepted)\n\nEA UNC Chapel Hill (rejected ;-;)\n\nRD UT Austin (accepted)\n\nEA UVA (accepted)\n\nRD Vandy (waitlisted)\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n* Start your essays early (preferably before senior year!) It helps to get ahead of the game and brainstorm, plus I find that I am dissatisfied with some part of an essay that i think needs editing a week or two after I finish\n* Familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of the Common App layout, like what each section entails (you might be surprised to find that it's a lot of info to fill out)\n* Look at examples of everything related to your application, whether it be the Common App, supplemental essays, and how to word your activities list\n* Don't downplay your achievements, but don't overly embellish them, either!\n* **Think about your application as a whole.** I cannot stress this enough! Is there an activity that is overly mentioned in your application? Try to balance your application out. Is there an aspect of yourself that you want to include but haven't yet? Try to touch on it in your supplemental essays. I go more in depth in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13si6wp/how_i_sold_myself_and_how_you_can_too_from_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* Apply to scholarships and treat them as you would your college apps! Also consider the finances and affordability of a school before totally committing to it and putting it on your list"

I felt that I had made a good impression on each of them in their classes as both had lab components where I was able to work with them personally. One of them was an introductory lab class that was more about writing reports than anything else, and the other was a Solidworks/MatLab/Excel class.\n\n\nEssays:\n\nI didn\u2019t spend much time writing or editing my essays and personal statements, but I have a knack for writing so I believe my essays were what contributed the most to my success with applications. My main essay in the Common App was about my disability and how it\u2019s both hindered and helped me grow as a person. I have a mobility issue that I\u2019ve had over 20 surgeries and countless days of physical therapy to correct. I didn\u2019t linger on that much though, and spent most of my essays talking about how it helped me gain a passion for robotics and engineering as well as how I still worked hard to keep up athletically with my classmates despite my disability. VT notoriously requires 4 more \u201cquick fire\u201d essays. For these I talked about volunteering at my local Science Museum, winning a gold medal at a swim team tournament when I was 12, a more specific narrative regarding my disability, and leading a final project for one of my freshman engineering classes. Main essay was a 9/10, VT personal essays were all 8/10\u2019s imo.\n\n\nOriginal Decisions\n\nAcceptances:\n\nVCU (committed)\n\nUMD College Park\n\nClemson\n\nSyracuse\n\nRejections:\n\nVT (ED)\n\nUniversity of Delaware\n\nNC State\n\n\nTransfer Decisions\n\nAcceptances:\n\nVT (committed)\n\nGMU\n\nRejections:\n\nNone\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nCouldn\u2019t be happier about my transfer application results! In high school I was forced to commit to VCU due to circumstances outside of my control instead of my #1 choice of UMD. I was never really a fan of urban campuses so I always felt out of place at VCU and didn\u2019t enjoy my time there. I\u2019ve struggled academically the past two years because of my gripes with the environment there leading to me having a pretty bad gpa and needing to retake several courses (hence why I only have 44 transfer credits). To be honest I went into transfer applications with the expectation that I only really had a chance at George Mason (Which I would have still been extremely happy with), and only threw in Virginia Tech for fun. I\u2019m ecstatic about being accepted into VT since I love their rural campus and their undergraduate engineering is excellent. The mountain biking in Blacksburg is also amazing according to my sister there. Unfortunately I\u2019m almost certainly not going to be graduating on time due to VT having stricter requirements than VCU as well as me already having retaken multiple classes at VCU, but I\u2019m not especially concerned about that."

She told me she tried to really showcase the strong qualities of myself that really shined through and would serve me best. She also told me she liked how I overcame challenges on the history day competition and how I was persistent/a grit student. I also did try my best in APUSH class and i feel like she probably wrote a lot about that, including about my character.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAP Psychology teacher (6/10): Wrote it in a couple of days, so not sure how strong it was. I feel like she somewhat got to know me in AP Psych class but nothing outside of the classroom. She also didn't know what COMMON APP when I asked her so this was probably a first for her, which is kinda a red flag lol but not anything bad. I feel like it was probably average to above average, but who knows it could have been well-written.\n\nCity employee internship advisor (5/10): I got the letter of recommendation after my internship and it was very generic, but i still asked her to fill it out for the community recommender part of the Common app recommendation section. I think she wrote like an extra sentence or two but people have told me it was very generic and didn't really demonstrate extra qualities about myself.\n\nInterviews\n\nHad 1 alumni interview with Dartmouth College. I would rate it a 7/10. I got along with her pretty well but I did have some hick ups but I really was able to express myself well. I did prepare for it but it wasn't anything extraordinary.\n\nEssays\n\nUC PIQ Essays (8.5/10): I spent a lot of time writing/editing my UC personal insight questions. I went to both my AP English literature and AP English language teachers, my counselor, one of my close friends, my APUSH teacher, and online \"advisors\" who somewhat helped although I did pay them upwards of $400 in total to review/edit. I started writing them on November 1st, but I went through so many drafts. I had like 40 pages of just drafts on the google doc. I did have lots of people go over it (which may have been a bad thing due to an overwhelming amount of different advice/feedback/edits they had). I also did pay for online college advisory services to look over my essays, which wasn't too helpful because they gave very minimal edits/feedback. I think three of my PIQ essays were pretty strong at the point . The fourth PIQ essay I started writing the week of the deadline and it turned out pretty good, but not super strong. I feel like one of my UC essays was especially strong for how well-written it was, how unique it was, and how much it demonstrated my personal values/challenges. I truly do feel like my essays on leadership, overcoming a challenge, favorite academic subject, and community essay shined through on me as an applicant and demonstrated who I was as well as my potential.\n\nCommon APP PS essay (7/10): As for my Common App Personal Statement Essay, I started on December 16th (one day after my birthday LOL). I tried being different and writing about an inanimate object I've had since I was young. I wrote about this and basically mixed in one of my strongest UC Essays from above into one really well-written essay. I think it was an alright essay but now looking back on it, it wasn't that well-written LOL. I didn't have a winter break and I remember editing one of my supplemental essays like 10 minutes before New Years LOL. I had like 20 supplemental essays to write and I think some of them were really well-written and insightful, while some were written as if it was written last-minute (because it was). But I really liked my community essay, at that point, it was really polished and well-written so I had that as my basis for all the community supplemental essays.  For my common app personal statement and supplemental essays, i spent upwards of $600 for online college essay editing services, which was absolutely not worth it because I feel like i could just relied on my personal feedback and not others. However, I did spend all my winter break applying to like 16 private schools, including writing the supplemental essays and common app personal statement that winter break.  The topic of my PS statement was more of a grit story and what I learned after working with my mom a lot with house cleaning and how it has changed my outlook on life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecisions: I only applied Regular Decision for all of them.\n\nRejections:\n\nAmherst College (social sciences major). \n\nBowdoin College  (social sciences major). \n\nBrown University (social sciences major). \n\nColby College (social sciences major). \n\nDartmouth College (social sciences major). \n\nDuke University (cs major) \n\nNorthwestern University (social sciences major). \n\nPomona College  (social sciences major). \n\nCalifornia State University - San Diego (cs major)\n\nSwarthmore College (social sciences major). \n\nUC Santa Barbara (cs major) \n\nUniversity of Southern California (cs major)\n\nWashington University in St. Louis (cs major)\n\nYale University.

Although I am a data science major and not comp sci, I really do feel like I can learn a lot at Cal!! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional Information: Although I only got I would get into mid-tier schools like UC Irvine or something, I am really happy about my results! Despite being rejected from almost all the private schools besides Vanderbilt and Pepperdine, I really did like how Vanderbilt chose me. It was a super difficult decision picking between Vanderbilt CS (intention to switch to college of engineering) and Berkeley Data Science, I ultimately chose Berkeley because of how prestigious it was for the technology sector and how close it was from home (around 2 hour drive). Although Vanderbilt truly did appeal to me with its student social life scene, academic and social life balance, good food, new location, happy student body, and rigorous academics, it was a bit too far from home. However, although I only got into 7 out of 27 colleges I applied for, I am happy that top universities did pick me and that I was able to choose from such excellent universities. Cal is where my next four years will be! Now, that's only if UCLA doesn't get me off their waitlist, but even then I might still choose Cal if I get off the waitlist. go bears!"

Spent months on it. Wrote about facing the devastating challenge of prematurely greying hair, which made me look older than my peers. Expounded by explaining how I  experienced body shaming and bullying, leading to insecurity, self-rejection, and a decline in confidence and self-esteem. The pressure to conform to society's standards of beauty, perpetuated by social media and celebrity culture, added to my feelings of inadequacy. However, a chance encounter with a fellow student who was also a victim of bullying sparked a transformation in the my life. I realized the importance of self-acceptance and began practicing self-love and surrounding themselves with supportive friends and family. Through personal growth and resilience, I overcame my insecurities and embraced my true self, becoming a confident and empowered individual, no longer afraid to take risks.  \n\n\nSupplementals: Extremely strong too.

Neither of us seemed to want to end the conversation, and I think I left an overall very positive impression while expressing my true self. 9/10\n\nDartmouth, Duke, Harvard: All in one week, back to back, so it was stressful. However, the constant practice made it so that these were all pretty good. 7/10\n\nUPenn ED: First interview so I was really nervous, but he kind of dominated and guided the conversation. Overall did decent. 7/10\n\nUT Austin Business Honors, MIT, Rice: Plain old generic college interviews. 5/10\n\nPrinceton: Was my first in-person interview, so I was super nervous. Lasted only 20 minutes, and I really felt like I put on a fake personality that def hurt my chances. 1/10\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement - 6/10. Generic essay about how a generic hobby taught me to learn from others. Spent maybe 8-10 hours on it? Really felt nervous about this tanking my application because a few friends said it was really really bad (not to be mean, they were genuinely trying to help). However, this was cancelled out by a few adults and college students saying it was really good, so idk. Overall was probably decent, and appealed to more serious readers.\n\nSupplementals: A majority were good, probably around 7-8/10. A few were super cringe looking back, so like 3/10, while a couple were genuinely 10/10. Even got a note from my Stanford AO saying she loved my essays. Lots of research and time put into the \"Why Us?\" essays. Took a huge risk on my why major essay, and it ended up leading to mixed results. The community essay was probably my weakest, while the essays in which I got to explain my family situation, express my passion for econ, and the 50ish-word short responses were my best. As a whole, I think my supplements and how I approached them through expressing my personality and passions rather than flexing my accomplishments really helped me stand out.\n\nJust a note on the essays: the amount of time you spend on an essay has no correlation to how good it is. It's perfectly fine to finish one quickly and use a first or second draft. Some of my best essays were written like this when I was just in a good mood and trying to finish quickly to go hang out - while the ones I grinded on for days (looking at you Princeton) ended up being fake and cringey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n**Acceptances**:\n\nUPenn Wharton ED Deferral ---> Acceptance\n\nUMich Ross EA\n\nIU Kelley EA\n\nUT Austin Business Honors EA\n\nTexas A&M EA\n\nStanford RD (committed!!)\n\nDartmouth RD\n\nCarnegie Mellon Tepper RD\n\nVanderbilt RD\n\nNotre Dame RD\n\nGeorgetown McDonough RD\n\nRice Business School RD\n\n**Waitlists**:\n\nHarvard RD ----> waitlisted then rejected\n\nCornell RD - opted out\n\nColumbia RD - opted out\n\nBrown RD - opted out\n\nDuke RD - opted out\n\n**Rejections**:\n\nMIT RD\n\nPrinceton RD\n\nYale RD\n\nNYU Stern RD\n\n**Additional Information/final reflections:**\n\nI think the biggest, biggest thing that I regret, and am still trying to overcome, is the glorification of Ivy students. What I mean by this is the echo chamber prevalent on this sub, and A2C and even among the students I met at the various competitions I participated in, that believes that anyone who gets into a school like Harvard or Stanford or any Ivy for that matter is somehow smarter or better than kids who get rejected. This belief led me to believe that only those with super stacked god-tier resumes get in, leading me to be completely shocked by my results. Looking back, even though I'm not a perfect applicant, I should've been a lot more confident and realized that I was definitely \"average\" for an Ivy applicant. I have a deleted post on an alt asking where I'd get in, and most people said Kelley and Ross at best. I think people as a whole need to realize that although college admissions is super selective and complete BS, the reason you won't get in is NOT because you didn't do enough, or because your resume is weak - it's because of factors like luck and institutional priorities. If I applied again, I could see myself getting into Stanford or Harvard again, or ending up at A&M or UT. It's literally all luck once you're past a certain point. I hope all applicants in the future are more optimistic (without being unrealistic), while taking the admissions process a little more lightheartedly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne final thing: if you're a prestige whore. Stop it now. It never ends. This is going to sound so fucking dumb, but until like last week, while I was waiting for Harvard waitlist results to come out, I genuinely had the thought that I wasn't \"good enough\" because I got into Stanford and not Harvard. WTF. I can't believe I genuinely thought something like that. Objectively I know it's false because I can see people on this sub with similar applications to me get into Harvard and not Stanford, and even without that, it's just so dumb to place my value on an admissions decision. I've really sat and thought about it for a while, and I think being a prestige whore comes from a mix of needing validation and also feeling insecure. I've been working towards addressing both, and hope in the future I won't give a shit what people think and will stop being in my own head.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the rambling at the end of this post! Good luck to the class of 2024 and all future classes applying! I hope everything works out amazing for you all, and dm or comment if you have any questions. Hopefully this post helped just a little."

Cofounder of an AI startup (12). I did this with a couple graduate students I knew and we've raised a decent amount in early funding. Dropped all other ECs senior year to focus on this.\n2. AI research at a T5 over the summer (11). I was accepted into a very selective program. Didn't publish anything but it was a good experience for college apps\n3. AI research at another T5 (10). Published a paper into a fairly reputable journal (not lead author though)\n4. CS research at my local college (9). Published paper as lead author, presented at a conference\n5. President of my school's peer-tutoring program (Member 9, President 10-12). I mostly help with Math and Physics (about 2 hrs/week)\n6. President of my school's CS club (Member 9, President 10-12). tbh we never do anything so I can still join and focus on EC #1\n7. Physics club vice president (member 9-11, President 12). Also do pretty much nothing.\n8. Volunteer at my local Buddhist temple (9-11). I work with new converts/people interested to help teach them more about the faith main Buddhist texts.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. 3x USACO plat (9,10,11) EDIT: For those curious about how 3x plat is possible, I qualified in 9th which meant I would stay in plat for future competitions (so I wrote 3x on apps) \n2. Winner of a prestigious national coding comp (11)\n3. Finalist in another prestigious tech comp (10)\n4. National Merit Semifinalist (11)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nMath Teacher (9/10): I knew him super well and we work together for the peer-tutoring program. We often talk during lunch.\n\nEnglish Teacher (7/10): I'm a good student but I don't know her as well as the math. I'm active in her class though and she seemed excited when I asked if she would write me a letter.\n\nProfessor at T5 (7/10): I worked with this guy everyday. Our relationship was pretty much limited to only technical stuff, but I think he had a lot to say.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT (first interview, dream school): Went really well and I clicked with the interviewer. She asked a lot of technical questions about my research, but I answered them well and she seemed impressed. I tried to act a lil \"quirky\" during the interview (since MIT's culture is like that) and she mentioned I'd be a good fit.\n\nPrinceton: Went well. Mostly talked about ECs and why I want to go.\n\nCornell: This was non evaluative. Consisted mostly of my interviewer talking about how the school was\n\nColumbia: No interview :(\n\nHarvard: Went well. The interviewer seemed impressed over how I name dropped certain professors and research groups I want to join.\n\nStanford: Nothing special. Mostly talked about why I wanted to go to the school. The interview ended in like 30 minutes :(.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App Essay (10/10): I spent 3 months pouring over this and it is honestly the best thing I have ever written. I spent like a month just outlining literary techniques and stuff I would use and it helped a ton. I had an English professor at my local college read it and say that it was \"one of the better\" student-written works they've seen. Lowkey trauma dumping (my hs english teacher cried when she read it) but I guess it worked\n\nSupplemental (7/10): Half of these were done like a week before the deadline. They related to my ECs pretty well though and I was able to elaborate on my research experiences.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nEA (0 safeties baby)\n\n* MIT (dream school frfr): >!Deferred \ud83d\ude2d (I was expecting this but it still hurt)!<\n* Georgia Tech OOS: >!Accepted!<\n* UT Austin OOS: >!Accepted!<\n* UC Berkeley IS: >!Accepted in an early wave!<\n\nRD\n\n* Caltech (first decision): >!Rejected (This coupled with the MIT deferral crushed my hopes over the next couple weeks)!<\n* MIT: >!ACCEPTED (WTF.

I adored the school when I visited. As I began to visit the other schools, I also really enjoyed Princeton. Cornell felt too isolated and Columbia was too urban, but Princeton fell right in the middle. I was still dead set on MIT though.\n\nIt was an incredibly difficult decision, but I chose Princeton. As much as I loved MIT, the tuition was too much for my family, and I couldn't pass up on the full ride. Go tigers!"

They were both a full page and very detailed, with concrete examples of my contributions in and out of the classroom. I actually got teary-eyed when reading them.

Duke was my best by far. It lasted about an hour and the conversation flowed very naturally and I really enjoyed it. Vandy was fine, it was relatively short but I think I gave good answers to the questions I was asked. It just wasn't notable by any means, but I don't think it hurt me. Yale was my last and worst interview lol. I had just finished all of my RD apps and I was tired. I think my interviewer was sick of interviewing too, so it was pretty boring and very surface-level. I would give Duke an 8/10, Vandy a 6/10, and Yale a 4/10. \n\nEssays\n\nI truly believe that my essays were the highlight of my entire application. I spent so much time perfecting and re-reading my essays, that I don't think they could have been any better. They were personal, but lighthearted, and each one really showcased a unique aspect of my personality. My advice to future applicants is to write a like a teenager, because you are. Don't write like an adult. I think that in the end, I found a nice balance between my person style of writing (which is very witty and lighthearted0 and a more sophisticated tone. I read so many of my friends' essays that were so robotic and formal and they just sounded bad. Keep it true to you, be human, and don't write like a middle-aged man, while still keeping it more formal than, say, a journal. \n\nDecisions\n\nAcceptances:\n\nDuke (ED, Deferred)\n\nPenn (Wharton)\n\nBrown\n\nUCLA (OOS)\n\nBerkeley (OOS)\n\nUVA (OOS, EA)\n\nUSC (EA)\n\nVandy\n\nBoston College\n\nSDSU\n\nCal Poly\n\nSanta Clara\n\nLoyola Marymount\n\nCornell (TO)\n\nWaitlists (declined all after getting into Duke):\n\nBU\n\nYale\n\nNorthwestern\n\nRejections:\n\nNone\n\nAdditional Information\n\nI'm still in shock at how things ended up for me, and I couldn't be happier! If you're curious, I have chosen to attend Duke in the fall! Ultimately, it was down to Duke, Penn, and Brown. I didn't forsee myself enjoying the weather in Providence (and the open curriculum was never super appealing to me, I never quite understood it) and I really don't care for Philly (or the more competitive culture at Penn/Wharton) so I chose Duke! Duke was always my dream school and the weather, access to undergraduate research, and overall vibe of the student body solidified my choice. I'm so so excited to be a Blue Devil! DDMF!!\n\nI realize that some people may be asking why I did not stay on the Yale waitlist. I was able to visit Duke in April and I completely fell in love with the campus and people, and knew that I would personally be happier there than at Yale. Based on NPCs, Duke would've been cheaper as well.\n\nEdit 1: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: Yes, Penn was Wharton and, yes, it hurt to turn down. I just think the culture at Penn (especially in Wharton) would've been too much for me."

As an engineering student, I got a lot of pushback from friends about not deciding to go to Georgia Tech because of its ranking and reputation in engineering specifically, but ultimately I liked the vibe / resources / flexibility of a smaller non state flagship colleg experience. Picking between Northwestern and Duke was really tough and I think there still is a chance I could end up regretting not choosing Northwestern, but ultimately Duke won me over by its campus, its weather (compared to Northwestern which gets very cold), semester system (Northwestern is quarter), and combined CS + Computer Engineering program (something I very likely will do). Overall though, the college process was definitely frustrating to me with me getting 11 waitlists, but ultimately I\u2019m super grateful and lucky / happy that it all worked out for me in the end."

Essays are the way to do this!! Once you got the baseline stats, make sure to be very vigilant with your essays; you'll already be ahead if you get your most important points across!\n\nApart from this, DO ECs THAT YOU ENJOY - excellence will follow, and you'll enjoy high school more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck class of 2024 and beyond!"

I applied to 7 schools EA (6/7 acceptances) with the intention of not applying to others if I was admitted to REA; I ended up applying to 11 more in December as I planned, tacking on 4 more in early January just to be safe. I applied to many public schools because transferring my dual enrollment credits is important to me. I visited all the East Coast and Midwest schools before applying. Many, but not all, of my choices were informed by various CS T20 lists.\r  \n\r  \n**Analysis of college decisions** \u2013 I predicted that I would get into less public schools and more private schools, because I\u2019m not a super hard-core CS kid, and my skill set is very diverse and strong, including in liberal arts. I still don\u2019t understand how that analysis could\u2019ve been more wrong. I recognize that I didn\u2019t apply to any mediocre private colleges, because if they both were not prestigious and didn\u2019t transfer my credits, I wouldn\u2019t attend. Nevertheless, I expected to get at least a couple. I was not particularly heart-broken by any of the decisions, though getting four rejections on my birthday wasn\u2019t my favorite experience. Perhaps I think too highly of my application in comparison to others, or perhaps my application doesn\u2019t adequately illustrate my competence. I likely would have done substantially better had I engaged in more academic competitions, such as olympiads, especially at CMU / Cal / Caltech. Overall, I am very happy with my public acceptances, and happy that my 100+ credit hours from dual enrollment and AP won\u2019t be going to waste. Someone who read my chanceme guessed my decisions almost exactly, but that\u2019s now deleted (not by me).\r  \n\r  \n**Other thoughts** about the college application process: I think that the current procedure is pretty silly. Millions of productive hours are wasted every year, and with dubious goals and outcomes. All aspects of the process are heavily influenced by race, wealth, and geography, and measures that are least impacted by these are actually deemphasized by the college application process. I think potential to learn is by far the most important criterion, and 90% of the college application does not assess that. People say that academics are a bad measure because i) too many people at the top for too few spots and ii) it\u2019s influenced too much by backgrounds. I\u2019ll refute that i) it is because academics at the high school level are categorically too easy, especially compared to other countries, achieving similar breadth but lesser depth \\[if I am prepared to proper ace upper division college STEM classes, then my peers should at least be prepared to pass lower division but not introductory STEM classes\\], and ii) that academic skill is far less reflective of status than essays or extracurriculars or really any other aspect of an application. The process in other countries, both in Europe, and my native Turkey, is far more streamlined, rapid, and does the same if not better job with placing students. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ll briefly talk about the idea of expensive **college counselors** \u2013 they are so unnecessary. I have several friends whom they gave awful advice to. People with counselors also tend not to do real research and not understand what they really want or need from a college. They are also the pinnacles of wealth-bias in college apps. I made the choice not to get a college counselor, and I don\u2019t think that it negatively impacted my application. And, your high school teachers (and your friends) are generally better essay reviewers than counselors.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, I\u2019ll list several bullet point pieces of **wisdom and advice for future classes:**\r  \n1. Create a college list where you\u2019d be content attending every college on the list, informed by what you need from a school rather than its perceived prestige.\r  \n2. Stay organized. My google sheet which I started two years ago served me well, taking me from preliminary research to finalizing lists to individual applications to making four-year ( or less ) plans for the colleges that did accept me.\r  \n3. Draft your essays early, especially personal statements.\r  \n4. Having a great why-us template is critical \u2014 one that seems specific even if it\u2019s not, can be easily customized with fifteen minutes of research, and can vary in length to fit various prompts.\r  \n5. Spend considerable time on your common application and how you present your activities. Make sure all your application materials are internally consistent \\[especially hour estimates\\], and reflect what you are answering in college-specific questions.\r  \n6. Fall in love with a college for the 3 hours you spend writing its supplements, and then fall out of love just as quickly as you fell in love.\r  \n7. Take challenging senior year courses, and don\u2019t slide. Academic momentum is important going to freshman year of college, not to mention a decent factor in college decisions as well.\r  \n8. Have some sort of a narrative in your activities and application, but don\u2019t engineer your application to be perfect starting in Kindergarten.\r  \n9. Find productive ways to employ your anxiety about the process. I\u2019m not going to say not to worry, because that\u2019s inevitable.\r  \n10. Submit applications earlier than they are due, double check for SAT/ACT score send requirements, pay your deposit earlier than May 1st, etc.\r  \n11. Meet with your high school counselor regularly throughout high school, so they can write you a good reference and get your stuff done when you need it done. (You\u2019re great Ms. P, if somehow ever see this and recognize me)\r  \n12. Discover yourself throughout the process. Writing about yourself is a great way to learn about yourself, but don\u2019t base your self-worth on your results or the results of your peers. Show yourself compassion, not toxicity.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading my post. Best of luck in college for the class of 2023 and best of luck in college applications for the class of 2022."
